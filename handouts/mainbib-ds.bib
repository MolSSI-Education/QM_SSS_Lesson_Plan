      implicit solvent models based on reaction-field theory and
      boundary-element discretization of the solute/continuum interface. An
      often overlooked aspect of these theories is that discretization of the
      interface typically does not afford a continuous potential energy
      surface for the solute. In addition, we show that discretization can
      lead to numerical singularities and violations of exact variational
      conditions. To fix these problems, we introduce the switching/Gaussian
      (SWIG) method, a discretization scheme that overcomes several
      longstanding problems with PCMs. Our approach generalizes a procedure
      introduced by York and Karplus [J. Phys. Chem. A 103, 11060 (1999)],
      extending it beyond the conductor-like screening model. Comparison to
      other purportedly smooth PCM implementations reveals certain artifacts
      in these alternative approaches, which are avoided using the SWIG
      methodology. The versatility of our approach is demonstrated via
      geometry optimizations, vibrational frequency calculations, and
      molecular dynamics simulations, for solutes described using quantum

      for electronic structure calculations by density functional theory and
      wave function theory. We especially emphasize minimally augmented basis
      sets and calendar basis sets. We base our conclusions on our previous
      experience with commonly computed quantities, such as bond energies,
      barrier heights, electron affinities, noncovalent (van der Waals and
      hydrogen bond) interaction energies, and ionization potentials, on
      Stephens et al.'s results for optical rotation and on our own new
      calculations (presented here) of polarizabilities and of potential
      energy curves of van der Waals complexes. We emphasize the benefits of
      partial augmentation of the higher-zeta basis sets in preference to full
      augmentation at a lower level. Benefits and limitations of the use of
      fully, partially, and minimally augmented basis sets are reviewed for
      different electronic structure methods and molecular properties. We have
      found that minimal augmentation is almost always enough for density
      functional theory (DFT) when applied to ionization potentials, electron
      affinities, atomization energies, barrier heights, and hydrogen-bond
      energies. For electric dipole polarizabilities, we find that
      augmentation beyond minimal has an average effect of 8\% at the
      polarized triple-zeta level and 5\% at the polarized quadruple-zeta
      level. The effects are larger for potential energy curves of van der
      Waals complexes. The effects are also larger for wave function theory
      (WFT). Even for WFT though, full augmentation is not needed for most
      purposes, and a level of augmentation between minimal and full is
      optimal for most problems. The calendar basis sets named after the
      months provide a convergent sequence of partially augmented basis sets
      that can be used for such calculations. The jun-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set is
      very useful for MP2-F12 calculations of barrier heights and hydrogen
      bond strengths."

      many‐electron analog to the natural orbital expansion of a
      two‐electron wavefunction. The orbitals involved may be approximated
      by pseudonatural orbitals (``PNO-CI''), and an efficient way of
      calculating these orbitals is presented. An approximate treatment of
      multiple substitutions is discussed yielding a coupled electron pair
      theory formulated within the CI scheme. These methods are applied to the
      ground state and three ionized states of methane. Including only double
      substitutions, the computed upper bound to the energy of the ground
      state is -40.4584 hartree, i.e. 0.057 above the experimental
      nonrelativistic energy. About 83\% of the total correlation energy is
      accounted for variationally, whereas the coupled‐pair approximation
      yields 89\%. The ratio between intraorbital and interorbital valence
      shell correlation energy is calculated as 1.56 in the case of localized
      electrons. The equilibrium distance in CH4 is found to be shifted from
      2.046 bohr to 2.061 bohr due to correlation, and the harmonic frequency
      ν1 is reduced from 3149 cm$^{-1}$ to 3037 cm$^{-1}$. These results
      indicate that the anharmonicity corrections to the observed values have
      probably been over estimated. The correlation contributions to the
      ionization potentials are analyzed. The theoretical potentials differ
      from the observed values by 1\%-2\%. The energy surface of CH4+ is
      investigated and is used to discuss the photoelectron spectrum of CH4.
      Contrary to previous work, the lowest minimum of CH4+ is found to have
      C2v symmetry. In all applications the variational results are compared
      with those of the independent‐pair and coupled‐pair approaches, and
      it is concluded that the latter represents a definite improvement over
      the first two."

      complex for open-shell systems.  At least for a single open-shell

      doubly occupied orbitals or among virtual orbitals.  However, it is not

      spin-couplings to the first-order interacting space. For MRCI, a
      CASSCF-MRCISD is not invariant to rotations of the active orbitals. 
      However, a SOCI has this invariance property because it includes
      references with the wrong spatial symmetry. For a SOCI in which not all

      The MRMP2 method, and many similar variants of multireference

      worthwhile to investigate whether simpler orbitals than those obtained
      from the full CASSCF procedure can provide useful accuracy. We are
      particularly interested in systems which require a multiconfigurational
      description over most or all regions of the potential energy surface. In
      this study we investigate the potential energy curves of the X1

      are demanding multiconfigurational test cases for which full CI results
      have been recently published. We compare our calculations with these

      orbitals. This obviates the need for contraction with overlap matrices

      rate-limiting step of our LMRSDCI algorithm to be driven by the search
      for two-electron integrals instead of configuration state functions. The
      shift necessitates a flexible way of processing the four-indexed
      two-electron integrals, which is facilitated by use of two-indexed
      Cholesky vectors. Our restructured LMRSDCI method is an order of
      magnitude faster and has greatly reduced storage requirements so that we
      are able to apply it to molecules containing up to 50 heavy atoms.

      efficient neglect of small contributions at several points in the

      to the following quantities: distant orbital pairs, the virtual space
      before and after the orthogonalizing projection to the occupied space,
      and small contributions in the transformation. A series of calculations
      on medium-sized molecules has been used to determine appropriate
      thresholds that keep the truncation errors small (below 0.01% of the
      correlation energy in most cases). Benchmarks for local second-order
      Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2; i.e., MP2 with a localized MO

      the memory demand is moderate even for large molecules, making

      a robust fourth-order methodology that extends the regime of practical

      easily be obtained for systems that contain more than 125 heavy atoms

      self-consistent field procedure and popular density functional theory

      MP2 is numerically assessed against untruncated RI-MP2 and DFT (B3LYP)
      in determining the relative energies of 27 different alanine
      tetrapeptide conformations at the cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, and 0) levels and
      the results are T -> Q extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. As
      the quality of the basis set employed increases, we report a significant
      reduction in the error introduced by the RI-TRIM approximation; at the
      cc-pVDZ level, the root mean-square (RMS) relative error was found as
      0.192 kcal/mol and is decreased to an almost negligible 0.040 kcal/mol
      at the T -> Q extrapolated complete basis set limit. Basis set
      dependence was investigated by computing the RMS (max) deviations from
      the extrapolated RI-MP2/cc-pV(TQ)Z data set found as 0.377 (0.944)
      kcal/mol (MP2/cc-pVTZ) and 0.250 (0.591) kcal/mol (TRIM MP2/cc-pVTZ).
      These deviations are chemically significant when compared against the
      conformer energy differences, suggesting that to obtain reliably
      converged relative conformational energies, computations must be done
      using the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets followed by extrapolation to
      the cc-pV(TQ)Z limit. The findings reported herein also provide the

      using the complementary auxiliary basis set approach. A hierarchy of
      well defined levels of approximation is introduced, differing from the
      exact theory by the neglect of terms involving matrix elements over the
      Fock operator. The most accurate method is denoted as MP2-F12/3B. This
      assumes only that Fock matrix elements between occupied orbitals and
      orbitals outside the auxiliary basis set are negligible. For the chosen
      ansatz for the first-order wave function this is exact if the auxiliary
      basis is complete. In the next lower approximation it is assumed that
      the occupied orbital space is closed under action of the Fock operator
      [generalized Brillouin condition (GBC)]; this is equivalent to
      approximation 2B of Klopper and Samson [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 6397
      (2002)]. Further approximations can be introduced by assuming the
      extended Brillouin condition (EBC) or by neglecting certain terms
      involving the exchange operator. A new approximation MP2-F12/3C, which
      is closely related to the MP2-R12/C method recently proposed by Kedzuch
      [Int. J. Quantum Chem. 105, 929 (2005)] is described. In the limit of a
      complete RI basis this method is equivalent to MP2-F12/3B. The effect of
      the various approximations (GBC, EBC, and exchange) is tested by
      studying the convergence of the correlation energies with respect to the
      atomic orbital and auxiliary basis sets for 21 molecules. The accuracy
      of relative energies is demonstrated for 16 chemical reactions.
      Approximation 3C is found to perform equally well as the computationally
      more demanding approximation 3B. The reaction energies obtained with
      smaller basis sets are found to be most accurate if the orbital-variant
      diagonal Ansatz combined with localized orbitals is used for the

      multiple resonance structures, which arises due to neglected
      correlations. We investigate the extent to which these problems can be
      removed by using second-order perturbation theory (PT) for weak
      correlations coupling three different electron pairs, and
      (infinite-order) coupled-cluster (CC) theory for stronger correlations
      involving electrons in only one or two pairs. The resulting Three-Pair
      Corrected Imperfect Pairing (TIP) method is explored here, and it is
      shown that to robustly combine CC and PT it is necessary to modify
      several aspects of the basic method. Most importantly, a penalty
      function term is introduced to ensure the PT amplitudes remain small.
      Comparison against CC treatment of the three-pair correlations suggests
      penalty terms will be beneficial for any hybrid CC/PT method that
      includes orbital optimization. The TIP method greatly reduces SB in
      aromatic hydrocarbons and recovers a significantly higher fraction of
      the valence electron correlation energy than IP."

      The significant SB known for the one-pair model (perfect pairing) is not

      Since MBIE provides rigorous upper bounds, numerical accuracy is fully

      thresholds for a specific accuracy is only weakly dependent upon the
      molecular system, our AO-MP2 scheme offers the possibility for
      incremental thresholding: for only little additional computational
      expense, the numerical accuracy can be systematically converged. We
      illustrate this dependence upon numerical thresholds for the calculation
      of intermolecular interaction energies for the S22 test set. The
      efficiency and accuracy of our AO-MP2 method is demonstrated for linear
      alkanes, stacked DNA base pairs, and carbon nanotubes: e.g., for DNA

      medium sized molecules in the range of 50-100 atoms and up to about 2000
      basis functions. The internal space is spanned by localized internal
      orbitals. The external space is greatly compressed through the method of
      pair natural orbitals (PNOs) that was also introduced by the pioneers of
      the CEPA approaches. Our implementation also makes extended use of
      density fitting (or resolution of the identity) techniques in order to
      speed up the laborious integral transformations. The method is called
      local pair natural orbital CEPA (LPNO-CEPA) (LPNO-CPF). The
      implementation is centered around the concepts of electron pairs and
      matrix operations. Altogether three cutoff parameters are introduced
      that control the size of the significant pair list, the average number
      of PNOs per electron pair, and the number of contributing basis
      functions per PNO. With the conservatively chosen default values of
      these thresholds, the method recovers about 99.8\% of the canonical
      correlation energy. This translates to absolute deviations from the
      canonical result of only a few kcal mol(-1). Extended numerical test
      calculations demonstrate that LPNO-CEPA (LPNO-CPF) has essentially the
      same accuracy as parent CEPA (CPF) methods for thermochemistry,
      kinetics, weak interactions, and potential energy surfaces but is up to

      The CC equations are solved and the correlation energies are calculated

      of the local subspaces and the accuracy of the results can be controlled

      Excitations are restricted to local subsets of non-orthogonal virtual

      very distant pairs. Only strong pairs, which typically account for more

      methods. All these methods are applied to the {O$_4^+$}, {O$_3$}, and

      variants provide significantly better vibrational frequencies than MP3,
      CCSD, and OD for the molecules where the symmetry-breaking problems are

      $\omega_6$ {$b_{3u}$} mode, where symmetry-breaking appears, is even
      better than presumably more reliable methods such as Brueckner doubles
      (BD), 1194 cm$^{-1}, and OD, 1193 cm$^{-1}$, methods (the experimental
      value is 1320 cm$^{-1}$). For {O$_3$}, the predictions of SCS-OMP3 (1143

      more robust OD method (1282 cm$^{-1}$); the experimental value is 1089
      cm$^{-1}$. For the seven diatomics, again the SCS-OMP3 and SOS-OMP3
      methods provide the lowest average errors, $\Delta$ $\omega_{e}$ = 44
      and 35 cm$^{-1}$, respectively, while for OD, $\Delta$ $\omega_e$ = 161
      cm$^{-1}$ and CCSD $\Delta$ $\omega_e$ = 106 cm$^{-1}$. Hence, the OMP3
      and especially its spin-scaled variants perform much better than the
      MP3, CCSD, and more robust OD approaches for considered test cases.
      Therefore, considering both the computational cost and the reliability,
      SCS-OMP3 and SOS-OMP3 appear to be the best methods for the
      symmetry-breaking cases, based on present application results. The OMP3
      method offers certain advantages: it provides reliable vibrational
      frequencies in case of symmetry-breaking problems, especially with
      spin-scaling tricks, its analytic gradients are easier to compute since
      there is no need to solve the coupled-perturbed equations for the
      orbital response, and the computation of one-electron properties are
      easier because there is no response contribution to the particle density
      matrices. The OMP3 has further advantages over standard MP3, making it
      promising for excited state properties via linear response theory."

      such as the CCSD-MP2 (i.e., $Y_{\Delta CCSD}$), CCSD(T)-MP2 (i.e.,
      $Y_{\Delta CCSD(T)}$), or the (T) separately. We found a correlation
      between the $Y_{MP2}$ and several other quantities, such as the percent
      of recovered optimization functional value in the truncated OVOS (OF\%),
      or the aforementioned $Y_{\Delta CCSD}$, $Y_{\Delta CCSD(T)}$,
      $Y_{(T)}$, which is to good approximation linear in the logarithmic
      scale. These correlations open a possibility to control the accuracy of
      the post-MP2 calculations in the truncated OVOS, because the $Y_{MP2}$
      and the OF\% are easily obtained, almost as a byproduct of the virtual
      orbital optimization. According to the results present in this work,
      knowledge of the YMP2 or the OF\% allows us to safely estimate the order
      of magnitude of the error of the post-MP2 corrections. To keep the
      accuracy of, for instance, CCSD(T) correlation energy calculated in the
      truncated OVOS within 1E-5 - 1E-6 Hartree error bars, we can typically
      reduce only a few percent of the OVOS, although this value increases
      slightly with enlarging the atomic orbital (AO) basis set and the number
      of inactive occupied orbitals. Still, even such a modest reduction can
      save more then a half of the computation time, compared with
      calculations in the full VOS. The situation is, however, much more
      favourable in case of counterpoise (CP) corrected calculations of
      interaction energy, where this methodology enables safe truncation of
      significant part of OVOS of monomers, resulting from the presence of the
      ghost AO. Dimension of such truncated OVOS essentially corresponds to
      CP-uncorrected calculations, thus leads to more than an order of
      magnitude speedup of calculation of monomers."

      from the standard coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), with

      mol(-1), although it gives reliable results near equilibrium geometries.
      The new symmetric triples correction, CCSD(Lambda), noticeably improves
      upon CCSD(T) (by 4-14 kcal mol(-1)) for BH, HF, and CH4; however, its
      performance is worse than CCSD(T) (by 1.6-4.2 kcal mol(-1)) for C-2 and

      asymmetric triples corrections, OD(T)(Lambda) and OD(Lambda)(T), perform
      better than OD(T) (by 2.0-6.2 kcal mol(-1)). The latter method is
      slightly better for the BH, HF, and CH4 molecules. However, for C-2 and
      N-2 the new results are similar to those of OD(T). For the BH, HF, and
      CH4 molecules, OD(Lambda)(T) provides the best potential energy curves
      among the considered methods, while for C-2 and N-2 the OD(T) method

      of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair
      natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are
      involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution.
      The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced
      through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation
      procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational
      effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N).
      Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane
      chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to
      semicanonical CCSD(T-0) is comparable to the previously developed
      DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are
      predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal/mol for a
      challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples

      parallel performance. In CCSD, the number of rate-determining
      contractions is also reduced; however, in EOM the number of operations
      is increased because the transformed integrals, which are computed once
      in the canonical implementation, need to be reassembled at each Davidson
      iteration. Nevertheless, for large jobs the effect of the increased
      number of rate-determining contractions is surpassed by the
      significantly reduced memory and disk usage leading to a considerable
      speed-up. Overall, for medium-size examples, RI/CD CCSD calculations are
      approximately 40\% faster compared with the canonical implementation,
      whereas timings of EOM calculations are reduced by a factor of two. More
      significant speed-ups are obtained in larger bases, i.e., more than a
      two-fold speed-up for CCSD and almost five-fold speed-up for EOM-EE-CCSD
      in cc-pVTZ. Even more considerable speedups (6-7-fold) are achieved by
      combining RI/CD with the frozen natural orbitals approach. The numeric
      accuracy of RI/CD approaches is benchmarked with an emphasis on energy
      differences. Errors in EOM excitation, ionization, and
      electron-attachment energies are less than 0.001 eV with typical RI
      bases and with a 10(-4) threshold in CD. Errors with 10(-2) and 10(-3)
      thresholds, which afford more significant computational savings, are
      less than 0.04 and 0.008 eV, respectively."

      method with single-, double-, and perturbative triple excitations
      (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) is an efficient quantum chemical method that allows for
      coupled cluster calculations on molecules with hundreds of atoms.
      Because coupled-cluster theory is the method of choice if high-accuracy
      is needed, DLPNO-CCSD(T) is very promising for large-scale chemical
      application. However, the various approximations that have to be
      introduced in order to reach near linear scaling also introduce limited
      deviations from the canonical results. In the present work, we
      investigate how far the accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method can be
      pushed for chemical applications. We also address the question at which
      additional computational cost improvements, relative to the previously
      established default scheme, come. To answer these questions, a series of
      benchmark sets covering a broad range of quantum chemical applications
      including reaction energies, hydrogen bonds, and other noncovalent
      interactions, conformer energies, and a prototype organometallic problem
      were selected. An accuracy of 1 kcal/mol or better can readily be
      obtained for all data sets using the default truncation scheme, which
      corresponds to the stated goal of the original implementation.
      Tightening of the three thresholds that control DLPNO leads to mean
      absolute errors and standard deviations from the canonical results of
      less than 0.25 kcal/mol ($<$1 kJ/mol). The price one has then to pay is
      an increased computational time by a factor close to 3. The
      applicability of the method is shown to be independent of the nature of
      the reaction. On the basis of the careful analysis of the results, three
      different sets of truncation thresholds (termed LoosePNO, NormalPNO, and
      TightPNO) have been chosen for black box use of DLPNO-CCSD(T). This will
      allow users of the method to optimally balance performance and
      accuracy."

      representation (ISR) concept, we here show how this restriction can be
      overcome in the case of the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC)
      propagator approach. In the ISR reformulation of the theory the basic
      ADC secular matrix is written as a representation of the Hamiltonian (or
      the shifted Hamiltonian) in terms of explicitly constructable states,
      referred to as intermediate (or ADC) states. Similar intermediate state
      representations can be derived for operators other than the Hamiltonian.
      Together with the ADC eigenvectors, the intermediate states give rise to
      an explicit formulation of the excited wave functions and allow one to
      calculate physical properties of excited states as well as transition
      moments for transitions between different excited states. As for the
      ground-state excitation energies and transition moments, the ADC excited
      state properties are size consistent so that the theory is suitable for
      applications to large systems. The established hierarchy of higher-order
      [ADC(n)] approximations, corresponding to systematic truncations of the
      IS configuration space and the perturbation-theoretical expansions of
      the ISR matrix elements, can readily be extended to the excited state
      properties. Explicit ISR matrix elements for arbitrary one-particle
      operators have been derived and coded at the second-order [ADC(2)] level
      of theory. As a first computational test of the method we have carried
      out ADC(2) calculations for singlet and triplet excited state dipole
      moments in H2O and HF, where comparison to full CI results can be made.
      The potential of the ADC(2) method is further demonstrated in an
      exploratory study of the excitation energies and dipole moments of the
      low-lying excited states of paranitroaniline. We find that four triplet
      states, T1-T4, and two singlet states, S1 and S2, lie (vertically) below
      the prominent charge transfer (CT) excitation, S3. The dipole moment of
      the S3 state (17.0D) is distinctly larger than that of the corresponding
      T3 triplet state (11.7D)."

      sensitive to the range-separation parameter; this sensitivity can be
      traced back to triplet instabilities in the ground state coming from the
      large effective amounts of Hartree-Fock exchange included in these
      functionals. As such, the use of standard long-range corrected
      functionals for the description of triplet states at the TDDFT level is
      not recommended."

      corrections is predicted to be 42.23 +/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1). For the
      barrierless decomposition of (HNO)-H-1 to H + NO, the dissociation
      energy is estimated to be 47.48 +/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1). For (NOH)-N-1 -> H
      + NO, the reaction endothermicity and barrier are 5.25 +/- 0.2 and 7.88

      constants for the isomerization and dissociation reactions were obtained

      weak enough that the CCSD(T)/FCI difference is well captured in these

      means of the W4 ab initio computational thermochernistry protocol, which
      has a 95\% confidence interval well below 1 kJ/mol. Our data sets
      include W4-08, which are total atomization energies of over 100 small
      molecules that cover varying degrees of nondynamical correlations, and
      DBH24-W4, which are W4 theory values for Truhlar's set of 24
      representative barrier heights. The usual procedure of comparing
      calculated DFT values with experimental atomization energies is hampered
      by comparatively large experimental uncertainties in many experimental
      values and compounds errors due to deficiencies in the DFT functional
      with those resulting from neglect of relativity and finite nuclear mass.
      Comparison with accurate, explicitly nonrelativistic, ab initio data
      avoids these issues. We then proceed to explore the performance of
      B2x-PLYP-type double hybrid functionals for atomization energies and
      barrier heights. We find that the optimum hybrids for hydrogen-transfer
      reactions, heavy-atoms transfers, nucleophilic substitutions, and
      unimolecular and recombination reactions are quite different from one
      another: out of these subsets, the heavy-atom transfer reactions are by
      far the most sensitive to the percentages of Hartree-Fock-type exchange
      y and MP2-type correlation x in an (x, y) double hybrid. The (42,72)
      hybrid B2K-PLYP, as reported in a preliminary communication, represents
      the best compromise between thermochernistry and hydrogen-transfer
      barriers, while also yielding excellent performance for nucleophilic
      substitutions. By optimizing for best overall performance on both
      thermochernistry and the DBH24-W4 data set, however, we find a new
      (36,65) hybrid which we term B2GP-PLYP. At a slight expense in
      performance for hydrogen-transfer barrier heights and nucleophilic
      substitutions, we obtain substantially better performance for the other
      reaction types. Although both B2K-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP are capable of 2
      kcal/mol quality thermochemistry, B2GP-PLYP appears to be the more
      robust toward nondynamical correlation and strongly polar character. We
      additionally find that double-hybrid functionals display excellent
      performance for such problems as hydrogen bonding, prototype late
      transition metal reactions, pericyclic reactions, prototype
      cumulene-polyacetylene system, and weak interactions."

      geometries, increases rapidly with the system size. The best performing
      WFT methods were found to be the SCS-CCSD (spin-component scaled CCSD,
      according to Takatani, T.; Hohenstein, E. G.; Sherrill, C. D. J. Chem.
      Phys. 2008, 128, 124111), MP2C (dispersion-corrected MP2, according to
      Hesselmann, A. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 144112), and MP2.5 (scaled MP3,
      according to Pito{\v{n}}{\'a}k, M.; Neogr{\'a}dy, P.; {\v{C}}ern{\'y},
      J.; Grimme, S.; Hobza, P. ChemPhysChem 2009, 10, 282.). Since none of
      the DFT methods fulfilled the required statistical criteria proposed in
      this work, they cannot be generally recommended for large-scale
      calculations. The DFT methods still have the potential to deliver
      accurate results for large molecules, but most likely on the basis of an
      error cancellation."

      calculations of thermodynamic properties such as atomization energies
      and heats of formation originates with the truncation of the
      one-particle basis set expansion. Unfortunately, the use of finite basis
      sets is currently a computational necessity. Even with basis sets of
      quadruple zeta quality, errors can easily exceed 8 kcal/mol in small
      molecules, rendering the results of little practical use. Attempts to
      address this serious problem have led to a wide variety of proposals for
      simple complete basis set extrapolation formulas that exploit the
      regularity in the correlation consistent sequence of basis sets. This
      study explores the effectiveness of six formulas for reproducing the
      complete basis set limit. The W4 approach was also examined, although in
      lesser detail. Reference atomization energies were obtained from
      standard coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples
      (CCSD(T)) calculations involving basis sets of 6$-\zeta$ or better
      quality for a collection of 141 molecules. In addition, a subset of 51
      atomization energies was treated with explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b
      calculations and very large basis sets. Of the formulas considered, all
      proved reliable at reducing the one-particle expansion error. Even the
      least effective formulas cut the error in the raw values by more than
      half, a feat requiring a much larger basis set without the aid of
      extrapolation. The most effective formulas cut the mean absolute
      deviation by a further factor of two. Careful examination of the
      complete body of statistics failed to reveal a single choice that out
      performed the others for all basis set combinations and all classes of
      molecules."

      phase for nine molecules (termed ROT25) was compiled from available
      experimental data. The medium-sized molecules with 18--35 atoms cover
      common (bio)organic structure motifs including hydrogen bonding and
      flexible side chains. They were each considered in a single
      conformation. The experimental B0 values were back-corrected to
      reference equilibrium rotational constants (Be) by computation of the
      vibrational corrections DBvib. Various density functional theory (DFT)
      methods and Hartree--Fock with and without dispersion corrections as
      well as MP2 type methods and semi-empirical quantum chemical approaches
      are investigated. The ROT25 benchmark tests their ability to describe
      covalent bond lengths, longer inter-atomic distances, and the relative
      orientation of functional groups (intramolecular non-covalent
      interactions). In general, dispersion corrections to DFT and HF increase
      Be values (shrink molecular size) significantly by about 0.5--1.5\%
      thereby in general improving agreement with the reference data.
      Regarding DFT methods, the overall accuracy of the optimized structures
      roughly follows the Jacobs ladder classification scheme, i.e., it
      decreases in the series double-hybrid > (meta)hybrid > (meta)GGA > LDA.
      With B2PLYPD3, SCS-MP2, B3LYP-D3/NL, or PW6B95-D3 methods and extended
      QZVP (def2-TZVP) AO basis sets, Be values, accurate to about 0.3--0.6
      (0.5--1)\% on average, can be computed routinely. The accuracy of
      B2PLYP-D3/QZVP with a mean deviation of only 3 MHz and a standard
      deviation of 0.24\% is exceptional and we recommend this method when
      highly accurate structures are required or for problematic conformer
      assignments. The correlation effects for three inter-atomic distance
      regimes (covalent, mediumrange, long) and the performance of minimal
      basis set (semi-empirical) methods are discussed."

     for dynamics simulations for a clear understanding of these systems;

     Selection rules need to be derived using the molecular symmetry
     (MS) group analysis, based on permutation-inversion group theory;
     point group symmetry is not applicable to such systems because
     of the large amplitude vibrational motions.  MS analysis is difficult

      Born–Mayer range parameter b and thus can be applied to all systems

      dissociation energy of the complex. Contrary to previous studies based
      on the Kitaura--Morokuma analysis, we find a clear theoretical
      distinction between H-bonded and non-H-bonded complexes based on the
      strength of CT interactions. Charge transfer is generally stronger in
      H-bonded than in non-H-bonded complexes. It plays an intermediate role
      in non-H-bonded CO2 complexes which have been studied experimentally.
      However, the internal rotation barrier (1 kcal mol$^{-1}$) of the
      H2O$\cdots$CO2 complex is found to be primarily of electrostatic origin
      with only a small ({$\pi$}-type) CT contribution. The role of
      electrostatic interactions, effect of electron correlation, and
      comparison of theory with experiment are also discussed"

      Approximations to E(c)[n] should reflect all this. In contrast, perhaps
      the well-known overbinding of the local-density approximation (LDA) in

      correlation energy is too sensitive to a coordinate scaling of n.
      Indeed, the LDA for E(c)[n(lambda)] diverges when lambda-->infinity
      because of the presence of the -1n(lambda) term in the Gell-Mann and
      Brueckner high-density expression for the correlation energy, per
      particle, of a homogeneous density, which is infinite. In a sense, the

      functions. This approach differs from existing methods, such as Stone's
      distributed multipole analysis (DMA), in including the short-range
      penetration energy as well as the long-range multipolar energy. The
      monomer charge densities are expressed as distributed series of
      atom-centered functions which we call Gaussian multipoles; these are
      analogous to the distributed point multipoles used in DMA. Our procedure
      has been encoded in the GMUL program. Calculations have been performed
      on the formamide/formaldehyde complex, a model system for N-H ... O
      hydrogen bonding in biological molecules, and also on
      guanidinium/benzene, modeling amino/aromatic interactions in proteins.
      We find that the penetration energy can be significant, especially in
      its contribution to the variation of the electrostatic energy with
      interaction geometry. A hybrid method, which uses Gaussian multipoles
      for short-range atom pair interactions and point multipoles for
      long-range ones, allows the electrostatic energies, including
      penetration, to be calculated at a much reduced cost. We also note that
      the penetration energy may provide the best route to an atom-atom
      anisotropic model for the exchange-repulsion energy in intermolecular

      depending on whether RNA or DNA strands are involved. These differences
      have been attributed to structural differences in the sugar-phosphate
      backbone of these two polymers. However, since there are in fact two
      structural features which distinguish DNA from RNA (the 2'-hydroxyl and
      C-5 methyl groups), the stability differences may arise from either or
      both of these factors. We have separated effects of the 2'-hydroxyl and
      C-5 methyl groups by synthesizing nucleic acid strands which contain all
      possible combinations with and without these groups. Studies of the
      stabilities of double and triple helices involving these strands show
      that in fact the C-5 methyl group of thymine and the 2'-OH group of
      ribose have equally large effects on stability. The two effects vary
      with secondary structure and can be reinforcing or even opposing in
      their influence on stability. Three types of complexes are specifically
      examined: bimolecular pyrimidinepurine duplexes, termolecular
      pyrimidinepurinepyrimidine triplexes, and bimolecular triplexes formed
      from circular pyrimidine oligonucleotides with purine target strands. It
      is found in general that the two types of substitutional effects are
      independent of one another and that C-5 methyl groups are in all cases
      stabilizing, while 2'-OH groups can be stabilizing or destabilizing,
      depending on the type of complex. In addition, studies with partially
      methylated duplexes lend evidence that the largest contribution to
      stabilization by the methyl group arises from increased base stacking
      ability rather than from a favorable hydrophobic methyl-methyl contact.
      The results allow explanation of observed differences in complexes of
      the two natural biopolymers. The data also point out what are the
      preferred structural features for highest-affinity synthetic
      oligonucleotide probes targeted to single- or double-stranded nucleic

      theoretical foundations through a reconstruction theorem for recent
      attempts at generating higher RDMs from the 2RDM to remove the

      representation for Valdemoro's reconstruction functionals [F. Colmenero,
      C. Perez del Valle, and C. Valdemoro, Phys. Rev. A 47,-971 (1993)] is

      Nakatsuji and K. Yasuda, Phys Rev. Lett. 76, 1039 (1996)] as well as a

      strategy, the ensemble representability method (ERM), is introduced to
      build the 3- and 4-RDMs by enforcing four-ensemble representability and
      contraction conditions. We derive the CSE in second quantization without

      and ERM reconstruction strategies are employed with the CSE to solve for
      the energies and the 2RDMs of a quasispin model without wave functions.
      We:elucidate the iterative solution of the CSE through an analogy with
      the power method for eigenvalue equations. Resulting energies of the CSE
      methods are comparable to single-double configuration-interaction (SDCI)
      energies, and the 2RDMs are more accurate by an order of magnitude than
      those from SDCI. While the CSE has been;applied to systems with 14
      electrons, we present results for as many as 40 particles. Results
      indicate that the 2RDM remains accurate as the number of particles

      geometries and seventeen trimer geometries have been studied using an
      interaction-optimized basis set. Because we aimed at transferability,
      all terms of the model were fitted separately, in order to obtain a
      potential in which these energy terms have a well-defined physical
      meaning. Electrostatic interactions were described by atomic multipole
      moments obtained by fitting to the monomer electrostatic potential. The
      polarization energy was modeled using atomic dipole polarizabilities.
      Scaled empirical polarizabilities reproduced the energy nonadditivity in
      methanol trimers very accurately. The dispersion energy was described by
      a damped r-6 atom−atom potential, which was fitted to separately
      calculated dispersion energies. Exchange energy and remaining
      short-ranged terms were modeled by an exponential repulsion term,
      including some anisotropic features. This repulsion model was fitted to
      the total SCF+MP2 interaction energies of the dimers. The maximum
      deviation for near-equilibrium geometries was 0.2 kcal/mol. The
      calculated interaction energies for dimers containing methane, water,
      and dimethyl ether were in similar agreement, both with our own ab
      initio calculations and with the best values available in the
      literature. In addition, trends in hydrogen-bond distances in these
      dimers and in methanol trimers were well reproduced by our model. So,
      the potential was seen to be transferable to related systems."

      simulations with forces derived from quantum mechanics at each time

      classically determined configurations. The method is not limited to free
      energies of solvation, and can potentially be applied to calculations of
      activation energies and other condensed phase chemical transformations.
      As a test, this method was used to calculate the free energy of
      hydration of water at ambient conditions. With a good classical model
      the method gives accurate results with only 50 quantum calculations. The
      method is self-correcting in the sense that it can be used to recognize
      a bad classical model, and improved classical models can be derived by a
      least-squares fitting to the quantum energies. As a result, this method

      this problem, the 'link atom' method and the 'local self-consistent
      field' (LSCF) formalism, are compared in this paper. For this purpose,
      the LSCF formalism has been introduced into the CHARMM program. A
      detailed description of the two approaches is presented. The results of
      semiempirical calculations of deprotonation enthalpies and proton
      affinities of propanol and a tripeptide with different treatments of the
      frontier bond are compared. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect
      of an external charge. It is shown that the choice of the QM/MM
      electronic interactions included in the frontier region is of
      considerable importance in determining the electron distribution of the
      QM region and the overall energy. The link atom and LSCF methods are
      generally of similar accuracy if care is taken in the choice of the
      frontier between the QM and MM regions. QM and QM/MM geometry
      optimizations of ethane and butane are also compared. The introduction
      of a link atom in the frontier bond is shown to lead to distortions of
      the internal coordinates unless the frontier bond is treated in a
      special way. A number of practical points concerning the choice of the
      frontier between the QM and MM regions are presented. It is not
      advisable to remove classical charges from the interactions with a
      subset of the quantum atoms, as this can introduce significant errors in
      the energy computations. The presence of a large charge on the classical
      atom involved in the QM/MM frontier also adversely influences the
      energy, especially with the LSCF method, and it is therefore advised to
      select classical frontier atoms with small charges. Charged atoms which
      are not directly bound to the QM frontier but which are in its proximity
      are also shown to be a source of errors, and it is advised to introduce
      warning messages In QM-MM codes when such a situation arises."

      suggest that these interactions can be classified as weak hydrogen
      bonds. A set of 12 interaction classes were defined based on the
      division of the donors into three groups and the accepters into four
      groups. These classes were examined separately, and described in detail
      in each class. Most prominent were interactions between aliphatic C-H
      donors and aromatic pi -acceptors and interactions between aromatic C-H
      donors and aromatic pi -acceptors. About three-quarters of the
      Trp-rings, half of all Phe and Tyr-rings and a quarter of all His-rings
      were found to be involved as accepters in C-H... pi -interactions. On
      the donor side, a preference for aromatic C-H groups was observed, but
      also for the aliphatic side-chains of the long, extended amino acid
      residues Lys, Arg and Met, and the Pro ring. The average distance
      between the C-donor and the center-of-mass of the pi -acceptor was
      observed to be significantly longer in the 174 protein structures
      determined at >2.5 Angstrom resolution. Also, the distribution is
      significantly wider. This resolution dependance suggests that the force
      fields commonly used for the refinement of protein structures may not be
      adequate. C-H... pi -interactions involving aromatic groups either as
      donor or as acceptor groups are found mostly in the interior of the
      protein. The more hydrophilic the participating groups are, the closer
      to the surface are the interactions located. About 40\% of all C-H... pi
      -interactions occur between amino acid residue side-chains that are
      separated by nine or less residues in sequence. Dependent on the
      interaction class, different preferences for secondary structure,
      residue type and side-chain conformation were observed. It is likely
      that the C-H pi -interactions contribute significantly to the overall

      density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory
      (SAPT) to calculate intermolecular interactions. This work was
      stimulated by the reported failures of supermolecular DFT calculations
      to adequately predict intermolecular land interatomic) interactions,
      particularly of the van der Waals type. The goals are to develop a
      hybrid scheme that will calculate intermolecular interaction energies
      accurately and in a computationally efficient fashion, while including
      the benefits of the energy decomposition provided by SAPT. The
      computational savings result from replacing the costly perturbation
      theory treatment with DFT, which should include the intramolecular
      correlation effects on the intermolecular interaction energies. The
      accuracy of this new hybrid approach (labeled SAPT(DFT)) is evaluated by
      comparisons with higher level calculations. The test cases include He-2,
      Ar-2. Ar-H-2, (H2O)(2), (HF)(2), CO2-CH3CN, and CO2-dimethylnitramine.
      The new approach shows mixed results concerning the accuracy of
      interaction energies. SAPT(DFT) correctly predicts all the qualitative
      trends in binding energies for all test cases. This is particularly
      encouraging in dimer systems dominated by dispersive interactions where
      supermolecular DFT fails to predict binding. In addition, the method
      achieves a drastic reduction (a factor of at least 100) in computational
      time over the higher level calculations often used to predict these
      forces. With respect to quantitative accuracy, this initial hybrid
      scheme, using the very popular exchange-correlation functional B3LYP,
      overestimates the second-order energy components (e.g., induction and
      dispersion terms) for all of the test cases, and subsequently
      overestimates the total interaction energy for all dimer systems except
      those heavily dominated by the electrotstatic interactions. The SAPT
      energy decomposition points to the use of DFT virtual orbital
      eigenvalues in the second-order perturbation terms as the likely cause
      for this error. These results are consistent with earlier work
      suggesting that DFT canonical virtual orbital energies obtained from
      commonly used functionals are less than optimal for use in such a
      perturbative scheme. The first-order interaction energy terms from the
      SAPT(DFT) are found to be generally more accurate than the second-order
      terms, and agree well with the benchmark values for dimers containing
      molecules with a permanent electric dipole moment. These first-order
      terms depend only upon the occupied MO eigenvectors, and hence are not
      affected by the inaccuracies in the Kohn-Sham DFT virtual orbital
      eigenvalues. These observations encourage future studies utilizing newly
      reported functionals, some of which have been developed to directly
      address problems with DFT virtual orbital energies and the asymptotic
      region of the electron density."

      permit rigid body translation and rotation of the QM region. This is
      essential if any atoms in the MM region are constrained, but it also
      improves the efficiency of unconstrained optimizations. Because of the
      microiterations, special care is needed for the optimization step in the
      QM region so that the system remains in the same local valley during the
      course of the optimization. The optimization methodology with
      microiterations, constraints, and step-size control are illustrated by

      (tetracene), pentacene, and hexacene, within chemical accuracy
      [0.02-0.07 eV]. The vertical ionization potentials of these compounds
      have been obtained from series of single-point calculations at the
      Hartree-Fock, second-, third-, and partial fourth-order Moller-Plesset
      (MP2, MP3, MP4SDQ) levels, and from coupled cluster calculations
      including single and double excitations (CCSD) as well as a perturbative
      estimate of connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)], using basis sets of
      improving quality, introducing up to 510, 790, 1070, 1350, 1630, and
      1910 basis functions in the computations, respectively. A focal point
      analysis of the convergence of the calculated ionization potentials has
      been performed in order to extrapolate the CCSD(T) results to an
      asymptotically (cc-pVinfinityZ) complete basis set. The present results
      confirm the adequacy of the outer-valence Green's function scheme for
      strongly correlated systems. Adiabatic ionization energies have been
      further determined by incorporating Beck-three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr
      functional corrections for zero-point vibrational energies and for
      geometrical relaxations. Extension of the analysis to the
      CCSD(T)/cc-pVinfinityZ level shows that the energy minimum form of the
      benzene radical cation is an obtuse structure related to the B-2(2g)
      state. Isotopic shifts of the adiabatic ionization potentials, due to
      deuterium substitution of hydrogens, have also been discussed."

      quite different. In other words, flexibility is a dangerous word for

      essential movements explain most of the natural flexibility of A-RNA,
      whereas many are necessary for B-DNA. Essential movements occurring in
      naked B-DNAs are identical to those necessary to deform DNA in
      DNA-protein complexes. which suggest that evolution has designed
      DNA-protein complexes so that B-DNA is deformed according to its natural
      tendency. DNA is generally more flexible, but for some distortions A-RNA
      is easier to deform. Local stiffness constants obtained for naked B-DNAs
      and DNA complexes are very close, demon-strating that global distortions
      in DNA necessary for binding to proteins are the result of the addition
      of small concerted deformations at the base-pair level. Finally, it is
      worth noting that in general the picture of the relative deformability

      in cases of homolytic bond cleavage due to the inability of the

      charges on distant fragments. However, for heterolytic bond cleavage,
      such as that observed in singlet ketene and propadienone,

      duplexes. The study has led us to show the following. (1) As the number
      of excess \%T in DR duplexes compared to the isosequential RD duplexes
      increase the differences in their thermal stabilization [$\Delta
      T_m$]$_{DR-RD}$ increase and vice-versa (2) The total relative
      stabilizations, [$\Delta \Delta G^0_{37}$]$_{DR-RD}$ among the 14 pairs
      of isosequential DR and RD duplexes (E. A. Lesnik and S. M. Freier,
      Biochemistry ,1995, 34, 10807) are wholly dependent on the differences
      in the number of 5-Me(T) stacking interactions with the
      nearest-neighbors in the D strands of DR duplexes compared to that of
      the RD duplexes (3) In the relative stabilization of the DR or RD
      duplexes differences in the free-energy of stackings [$\Delta $Delta
      G_{stacking}$]$_{DR-RD}$ play a more significant role than the
      differences in the free-energy of base-pairing, [$\Delta \Delta

      that RNA-RNA duplexes are more stable than DNA-DNA duplexes because of

      latter (P. Acharya, P. Cheruku,S. Chatterjee, S. Acharya and J.

      We find that this decay can be surprisingly slow. Numerical experiments
      on linear alkanes and a toy model both show that the decay can be as
      slow as 1/r in the distance between the auxiliary function and the
      fitted charge distribution. The Coulomb metric fitting equations also
      involve divergent matrix elements for extended systems treated with
      periodic boundary conditions. An attenuated Coulomb metric that is
      short-range can eliminate these oddities without substantially degrading
      calculated relative energies. The sparsity of the fit coefficients is
      assessed on simple hydrocarbon molecules and shows quite early onset of
      linear growth in the number of significant coefficients with system size
      using the attenuated Coulomb metric. Hence it is possible to design
      linear scaling auxiliary basis methods without additional approximations
      to treat large systems."

      the nature of the hydrogen bonds in DNA base pairs in terms of

      dispersion-energy terms, where the Heitler–London energy term is
      composed of electrostatic and Pauli-exchange interactions. A modest
      electron-transfer effect is found in the Watson–Crick
      adenine–thymine (AT), guanine–cytosine (GC) and Hoogsteen
      adenine-thymine (H-AT) pairs, confirming the weak covalence in the
      hydrogen bonds.  The electrostatic attraction and polarization effects
      account for most of the binding energies, particularly in the GC pair. 
      Both theoretical and experimental data show that the GC pair has a
      binding energy (−25.4 kcal mol−1 at the MP2/6-31G** level) twice
      that of the AT (−12.4 kcal mol−1) and H-AT

      N-H···O(N) hydrogen bonds in the GC pair and two in the AT or H-AT
      pair. Although the remarkably strong binding between the guanine and
      cytosine bases benefits from the opposite orientations of the dipole
      moments in these two bases assisted by the π-electron delocalization
      from the amine groups to the carbonyl groups, model calculations
      demonstrate that π-resonance has very limited influence on the
      covalence of the hydrogen bonds. Thus, the often adopted terminology
      resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding (RHAB) may be replaced with
      resonance-assisted binding which highlights the electrostatic rather
      than electron-transfer nature of the the electrostatic rather than
      electron-transfer nature of the enhanced stabilization, as hydrogen

      Theoretical consideration on the surface plasmon resonance condition

      surrounding materials, has two controlling factors: first the bulk
      plasma wavelength, a property dependent on the metal type, and second on
      the aspect ratio of the nanorods which is a geometrical parameter. It is
      found that the sensitivity is linearly proportional to both these
      factors. To quantitatively examine the dependence of the spectral

      each electron pair uses a set of (contracted) Gaussian-type geminals
      (GTGs) with fixed exponents, whose coefficients are optimized linearly.
      The following features distinguish the current method from related

      two-electron integrals are needed, (2) the only approximations are the
      resolution of the identity and the generalized Brillouin condition, (3)
      only linear parameters are optimized, and (4) an arbitrary number of
      (non-)contracted GTGs can appear. The present method using only three
      GTGs and a double-zeta quality basis computed valence correlation
      energies for a set of 20 small molecules only 2.2 pct removed from the
      basis set limit. The average basis set error reduces to 1.2 pct using a
      near-complete set of seven GTGs with the double-zeta basis set. The
      conventional MP2 energies computed with much larger quadruple,
      quintuple, and sextuple basis sets all had larger average errors: 4.6
      pct, 2.4 pct, and 1.5 pct.  The new method compares well to the
      published MP2-R12 method using a single Slater-type geminal (STG)
      correlation factor. For example, the average basis set error in the
      absolute MP2-R12 energy obtained with the exp(-r(12)) correlation factor
      is 1.7 pct. Correlation contribution to atomization energies evaluated
      with the present method and with the STG-based method only required a
      double-zeta basis set to exceed the precision of the conventional
      sextuple-zeta result. The new method is shown to always be numerically

      93, 213001 (2004)]. In this paper we synthesize these two directions in
      a class of techniques which we call parametric variational 2-RDM
      methods. The 2-RDM in these methods is parametrized to be size
      consistent while approximately satisfying the N-representability
      conditions. We extend an energy functional of Kollmar [C. Kollmar, J.
      Chem. Phys. 125, 084108 (2006)], which modifies configuration
      interaction with double excitations to be size consistent, by including

      valance double-zeta (cc-pVDZ) basis sets. Energies as well as properties
      from the parametric variational 2-RDM method, particularly at

      work shows clearly that, except in the dissociation of N(2), the
      deviation of the 2-RDM from the well-known N-representability
      conditions, such as the D, Q, and G conditions, is negligible.
      Furthermore, calculations with helium atoms demonstrate the size
      consistency of the method. The computational results on N
      representability and size consistency are especially important because
      they legitimatize the selected parametrization of the 2-RDM."

      non-bulk-electrostatic contribution arising from short-range

      parametrized by a training set of 220 bare ions and 21 clustered ions in
      acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide. The
      non-bulk-electrostatic terms are proportional to the solvent-accessible

      using solvation free energies for a training set of 2346 solvation free
      energies for 318 neutral solutes in 90 nonaqueous solvents and water and
      143 transfer free energies for 93 neutral solutes between water and 15

      converge asymptotically as similar to(L+1)(-3) to the complete basis set
      limit, where L is the maximum angular momentum quantum number included

      correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pVXZ for coupled cluster singles
      and doubles (CCSD) and second order perturbation theory (MP2)
      calculations of molecules. The main focus of this article is to probe
      for deviations from asymptotic convergence behavior for practical values
      of X by defining a trial function X-beta that for an effective exponent
      beta=beta(eff)(X,X+1,X+N) provides the correct energy EX+N, when
      extrapolating from results for two smaller basis sets, E-X and EX+1.
      This analysis is first applied to model expansions available from
      analytical theory, and then to a large body of finite basis set results
      (X=D,T,Q,5,6) for 105 molecules containing H, C, N, O, and F,
      complemented by a smaller set of 14 molecules for which accurate
      complete basis set limits are available from MP2-R12 and CCSD-R12
      calculations. beta(eff) is generally found to vary monotonically with
      the target of extrapolation, X+N, making results for large but finite
      basis sets a useful addition to the limited number of cases where
      complete basis set limits are available. Significant differences in
      effective convergence behavior are observed between MP2 and CCSD
      (valence) correlation energies, between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-free
      molecules, and, for He, between partial-wave expansions and
      correlation-consistent basis sets. Deviations from asymptotic
      convergence behavior tend to get smaller as X increases, but not always
      monotonically, and are still quite noticeable even for X=5. Finally,
      correlation contributions to atomization energies (rather than total
      energies) exhibit a much larger variation of effective convergence
      behavior, and extrapolations from small basis sets are found to be
      particularly erratic for molecules containing several electronegative
      atoms. Observed effects are discussed in the light of results known from
      analytical theory. A carefully calibrated protocol for extrapolations to
      the complete basis set limit is presented, based on a single optimal
      exponent beta(opt)(X,X+1,infinity) for the entire set of molecules, and

      Calculations at nonequilibrium geometries further show that cumulant

      The approach acts at the charge (or monopole) level only and allows the

      cost. Results are compared with density functional theory Coulomb
      intermolecular interaction energies and with several other methods such
      as distributed multipoles, damped distributed multipoles, and
      transferable Hermite-Gaussian densities. Realistic trends in the
      interactions are observed for atom-centered Mertz-Kollman corrected
      point-charge distributions. The approach allows increasing the
      selectivity of parameters in the case of metal complexes. In addition,
      two QM/MM calculations are presented where the damping function is
      employed to include the MM atoms located at the QM/MM boundary. The
      first calculation corresponds to the gas-phase proton transfer of
      aspartic acid through water and the second is the first step of the
      reaction catalyzed by the 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4OT) enzyme.
      First, improved agreement is observed when using the damping approach
      compared with the conventional excluded charge method or when including
      all charges in the calculation. Second, in the case of 4OT, the damped
      charge approach is in agreement with previous calculations, whereas
      including all charges gives a significantly higher energy barrier. In

      routinely applied for systems of up to 1000 atoms. For nonaromatic

      An iterative scheme for the calculation of the Lieb functionals under
      the appropriate constraints is outlined following the direct
      optimization approach of Wu and Yang [J. Chem. Phys. 118, 2498 (2003)].
      First- and second-order optimization schemes for the calculation of
      accurate adiabatic-connection integrands are investigated and compared;
      the latter is preferred both in terms of computational efficiency and
      accuracy. The scheme is applicable to systems of any number of
      electrons. However, to determine the accuracy that may be achieved, the
      present work focuses on two-electron systems for which a number of
      simplifications may be exploited. The procedure is applied to the helium
      isoelectronic series and the H-2 molecule. The resulting
      adiabatic-connection curves yield the full configuration-interaction
      exchange-correlation energies extrapolated to the basis-set limit. The
      relationship between the Kohn-Sham and natural orbitals as functions of
      the electron-electron interaction strength is explored in detail for
      H-2. The accuracy with which the exchange-correlation contributions to
      the modified local potential can be determined is discussed. The new
      accurate adiabatic-connection curves are then compared with some
      recently investigated approximate forms calculated using accurate full
      configuration-interaction input data. This study demonstrates that the
      adiabatic-connection integrand may be determined accurately and
      efficiently, providing important insights into the link between the
      Kohn-Sham and traditional quantum-chemical treatments of the

      parametric 2-RDM method with one of these improved functionals through
      its application to the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to oxywater.
      Previous work has predicted the barrier from oxywater to hydrogen
      peroxide with zero-point energy correction to be 3.3-to-3.9 kcal/mol
      from coupled cluster with perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] and
      -2.3 kcal/mol from complete active-space second-order perturbation

      polarized quadruple-zeta basis set (aug-cc-pVQZ)-with extrapolation to
      the complete basis-set limit, we examined the barrier with two
      parametric 2-RDM methods and three coupled cluster methods. In the

      energy of 2.1 kcal/mol while the CCSD(T) barrier becomes 4.2 kcal/mol.
      The dissociation energy of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals is
      also compared to the activation energy for oxywater formation. We report

      the cost of calculating an exact Hessian increases more rapidly with

      molecular dynamics simulations (63 simulations with 8.4 fs of simulation

      using the latest variant of the Cornell et al. AMBER RNA force field
      bscOL3 , while several other RNA force fields have been tested. The
      calculations show that the A-RNA helix compactness, described mainly by
      geometrical parameters inclination, base pair roll, and helical rise, is
      sequence-dependent. In the calculated set of structures, the inclination
      varies from 10 to 24 Ang. On the basis of simulations with modified
      bases (inosine and 2,6-diaminopurine), we suggest that the
      sequence-dependence of purely canonical A-RNA double helix is caused by
      the steric shape of the base pairs, i.e., the van der Waals
      interactions. The electrostatic part of stacking does not appear to
      affect the A-RNA shape. Especially visible is the role of the minor
      groove amino group of purines. This resembles the so-called
      Dickerson-Calladine mechanical rules suggested three decades ago for the
      DNA double helices. We did not identify any long-living backbone
      substate in A-RNA double helices that would resemble, for example, the
      B-DNA BI/BII dynamics. The variability of the A-RNA compactness is due
      to mutual movements of the consecutive base pairs coupled with modest
      change of the glycosidic torsion. The simulations further show that the
      A-RNA compactness is modestly affected by the water model used, while
      the effect of ionic conditions, investigated in the range from
      net-neutral condition to 0.8 M monovalent ion excess salt, is smaller."

      Somewhat surprisingly, the best vibrational CI results agreed with the
      VPT2 values with a mean unsigned deviation of just 0.09 kJ/mol and a
      standard deviation of just 0.11 kJ/mol. The largest difference was
      observed for C4 H4 O (0.34 kJ/mol). A simplified version of the

      calculations using the B3LYP/6-31G** density functional theory PES
      provide the best agreement with the experimental measurements. This
      agreement is likely due to the better overall description that B3LYP
      provides for geometries well removed from the minimum energy path, even
      though its barrier height is low by $\sim$ 0.2 eV. In contrast to
      previous theoretical calculations, the angular distributions on this
      surface show behavior associated with a stripping mechanism, even at
      collision energies only ∼0.1 eV above the reaction barrier. Other
      potential energy surfaces, which include an analytical potential energy
      surface from Espinosa-Garc{\'i}a and a direct dynamics calculation based
      on the MSINDO semiempirical Hamiltonian, are less accurate and predict
      more rebound dynamics at these energies than is observed.
      Reparametrization of the MSINDO surface, though yielding better
      agreement with the experiment, is not sufficient to capture the observed
      dynamics. The differences between these surfaces are interpreted using
      an analysis of the opacity functions, where we find that the wider cone
      of acceptance on the B3LYP surface plays a crucial role in determining
      the integral cross sections and angular distributions."

      connection theorem, he proposes that the exchange-correlation potential
      be modeled by a simple average (linear approximation) of the
      noninteracting system (Hartree-Fock exchange) and the fully interacting
      system (as modeled by XC for LSDA).  This leads to the use of a {\em

      exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is
      obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual
      orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that
      describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and
      GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a
      least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations.
      Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to
      be quite large (53 pct with c=27 pct) which at least in part explains
      the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to
      conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed
      B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test
      suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as
      electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds,
      weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with
      other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many
      realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose
      density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for
      the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5
      kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very
      importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly
      reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are
      obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at
      such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of
      equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond
      lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and
      transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The
      uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical
      systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that
      describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation
      functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to
      be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical
      method of general purpose."

      124, 034108). The only known shortcoming of these generally highly
      accurate functionals is an underestimation of the long-range dispersion
      (van der Waals) interactions. To correct this deficiency, we add a
      previously developed empirical dispersion term (DFT-D) to the energy
      expression but leave the electronic part of the functional untouched.
      Results are presented for the S22 set of non-covalent interaction
      energies, the G3/99 set of heat of formations and conformational
      energies of a phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine peptide model. We furthermore
      propose seven hydrocarbon reactions with strong intramolecular
      dispersion contributions as a benchmark set for newly developed density
      functionals. In general, the proposed composite approach is for many
      chemically relevant properties of similar quality as high-level
      coupled-cluster treatments. A significant increase of the accuracy for
      non-covalent interactions is obtained and the corrected B2PLYP DHDF
      provides one of the lowest ever obtained Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD)
      for the S22 set (0.2-0.3 kcal mol(-1)). Unprecedented high accuracy is
      also obtained for the relative energies of peptide conformations that
      turn out to be very difficult. The significant improvements found for
      the G3/99 set (reduction of the MAD from 2.4 to 1.7 kcal mol(-1))
      underline the importance of intramolecular dispersion effects in large
      molecules. In all tested cases the results from the standard B3LYP

      Our M06-class functionals depend on spin-up and spin-down electron
      densities (i.e., spin densities), spin density gradients, spin kinetic
      energy densities, and, for nonlocal (also called hybrid) functionals,
      Hartree−Fock exchange. We have developed four new functionals that

      functional, is a functional with good accuracy across-the-board for the

      transition metals and is the only non-hybrid functional with better
      across-the-board average performance than B3LYP; (d) M06-HF has good

      means of the W4 ab initio computational thermochernistry protocol, which
      has a 95\% confidence interval well below 1 kJ/mol. Our data sets
      include W4-08, which are total atomization energies of over 100 small
      molecules that cover varying degrees of nondynamical correlations, and
      DBH24-W4, which are W4 theory values for Truhlar's set of 24
      representative barrier heights. The usual procedure of comparing
      calculated DFT values with experimental atomization energies is hampered
      by comparatively large experimental uncertainties in many experimental
      values and compounds errors due to deficiencies in the DFT functional
      with those resulting from neglect of relativity and finite nuclear mass.
      Comparison with accurate, explicitly nonrelativistic, ab initio data
      avoids these issues. We then proceed to explore the performance of
      B2x-PLYP-type double hybrid functionals for atomization energies and

      y and MP2-type correlation x in an (x, y) double hybrid. The (42,72)
      hybrid B2K-PLYP, as reported in a preliminary communication, represents
      the best compromise between thermochernistry and hydrogen-transfer
      barriers, while also yielding excellent performance for nucleophilic
      substitutions. By optimizing for best overall performance on both
      thermochernistry and the DBH24-W4 data set, however, we find a new
      (36,65) hybrid which we term B2GP-PLYP. At a slight expense in
      performance for hydrogen-transfer barrier heights and nucleophilic
      substitutions, we obtain substantially better performance for the other
      reaction types. Although both B2K-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP are capable of 2
      kcal/mol quality thermochemistry, B2GP-PLYP appears to be the more
      robust toward nondynamical correlation and strongly polar character. We
      additionally find that double-hybrid functionals display excellent
      performance for such problems as hydrogen bonding, prototype late

      For weakly interacting systems, acceptable accuracy in semilocal

      a further approximation in which the electronic part of the XDM gradient

      electronically difficult cases can be produced in an unforeseeable

      AMs are systematically decomposed into small molecules (hydrides and
      diatomics). Two different example test sets containing eight-atom,
      single-reference, main group AMs with chemically very diverse and
      unusual structures are generated. Highly accurate all-electron,

      decreases very strongly from LDA (20 kcal/mol) to GGAs (MAD of about 10

      investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five
      double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern
      approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and
      range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new
      DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the
      performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters
      are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis
      set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of
      the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable
      and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we
      recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The
      best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no
      clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the
      widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all
      tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of
      dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method
      without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often
      done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals
      do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard
      hybrids. However, the ωB97X-D functional seems to be a promising
      method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional
      in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required,
      double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and
      PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the
      entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled
      variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in
      general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly
      for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large
      self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of
      double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the
      classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be
      confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical
      correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and
      the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies."

      detail the XYG3 functional [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009, 106,

      70\% Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange, while for the correlation
      contributions, the use of independently optimized spin-component-scaled
      Moller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (SCS-MP2) parameters
      (MP2OS and MP2SS) is beneficial. The triple-zeta Dunning aug'-cc-pVTZ+d
      and Pople 6-311+G (3df,2p)+d basis sets are found to be cost-effective
      for DHDFT methods. As a result, we have formulated the DuT-D3 DHDFT
      procedure, which employs the aug'-cc-pVTZ+d basis set and includes 30\%
      B88 and 70\% HF exchange energies, 59\% LYP, 47\% MP2OS, and 36\% MP2SS

      32\% B88 and 68\% HF exchange energies, 63\% LYP, 46\% MP2OS, and 27\%

      of repeat units, for saturated alkane chains, however, 1/omega quickly
      saturates after 5-6 repeat units. For oligothiophenes, we find that
      1/omega grows linearly for the shorter oligomers but then saturates at
      around 10 repeat units. Our results point to a close relation between
      the optimal range-separation parameter and the degree of conjugation in

      approach the performance of composite ab initio methods such as G3

      coefficients of each component [density functional theory (DFT), exact
      exchange, and perturbative correlation in both the same spin and
      opposite spin terms], and the addition of an ad-hoc dispersion
      correction; we have termed these parametrizations DSD-DFT (Dispersion
      corrected, Spin-component scaled, Double-hybrid DFT). Somewhat
      surprisingly, the quality of DSD-DFT is only mildly dependent on the
      underlying DFT exchange and correlation components, with even DSD-LDA
      yielding respectable performance. Simple, nonempirical GGAs appear to

      and robust formalism for investigating the electronic structure of
      many-body systems while providing a practical balance of accuracy and
      computational cost unmatched by other methods. Despite this success, the
      commonly used semilocal approximations have difficulties in properly
      describing attractive dispersion interactions that decay with R-6 at
      large intermolecular distances. Even in the short to medium range, most
      semilocal density functionals fail to give an accurate description of
      weak interactions. The omnipresence of dispersion interactions, which
      are neglected in the most popular electronic structure framework, has
      stimulated intense developments during the past decade. In this Account,
      we summarize our effort to develop and implement dispersion corrections
      that dramatically reduce the failures of both inter- and intramolecular
      interaction energies. The proposed schemes range from improved variants
      of empirical atom pairwise dispersion correction (e.g., dD10) to robust
      formulations dependent upon the electron density. Emphasis has been
      placed on introducing more physics into a modified Tang and Toennies
      damping function and deriving accurate dispersion coefficients. Our most
      sophisticated and established density-dependent correction, dDsC, is
      based on a simple generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-like
      reformulation of the exchange hole dipole moment introduced by Becke and
      Johnson. Akin to its empirical precursor, dDsC dramatically improves the
      interaction energy of a variety of standard density functionals
      simultaneously for typical intermolecular complexes and shorter-range
      interactions occurring within molecules. The broad applicability and
      robustness of the dDsC scheme is demonstrated on various representative
      reaction energies, geometries, and molecular dynamic simulations. The
      suitability of the a posteriori correction is also established through
      comparisons with the more computationally demanding self-consistent
      implementation. The proposed correction is then exploited to identify
      the key factors at the origin of the errors in thermochemistry beyond
      van der Waals complexes. Particular focus is placed on charge-transfer
      and mixed-valence complexes, which are relevant to the field of organic
      electronics. These types of complexes represent insightful examples for
      which the delocalization error may partially counterbalance the missing
      dispersion. Our devised methodology reveals the true performance of
      standard density functional approximations and the subtle interplay
      between the two types of errors. The analysis presented provides
      guidance for future functional development that could further improve
      the modeling of the structures and properties of molecular materials.
      Overall, the proposed state-of-the-art approaches have contributed to
      stress the crucial role of dispersion and improve their description in
      both straightforward van der Waals complexes and more challen"

      including DNA and RNA base pairs. In an effort to better understand the
      fundamental physics of hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), we investigate the
      distance dependence of interaction energies in the prototype bimolecular
      complexes of formic acid, formamide, and formamidine. Potential energy
      curves along the H-bonding dissociation coordinate are examined both by
      establishing reference CCSD(T) interaction energies extrapolated to the
      complete basis set limit and by assessing the performance of the density
      functional methods B3LYP, PBE, PBE0, B970, PB86, M05-2X, and M06-2X and
      empirical dispersion corrected methods B3LYP-D3, PBE-D3, PBE0-D3,
      B970-D2, BP86-D3, and $\omega$B97X-D, with basis sets 6-311++G(3df,3pd),
      aug-cc-pVDZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ. Although H-bonding interactions are
      dominated by electrostatics, it is necessary to properly account for
      dispersion interactions to obtain accurate energetics. In order to
      quantitatively probe the nature of hydrogen bonding interactions as a
      function of distance, we decompose the interaction energy curves into
      physically meaningful components with symmetry-adapted perturbation
      theory (SAPT). The SAPT results confirm that the contribution of
      dispersion and induction are significant at and near equilibrium,
      although electrostatics dominate. Among the DFT/DFT-D techniques, the
      best overall results are obtained utilizing counterpoise-corrected
      $\omega$B97X-D with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set."

      easier because there is no response contribution to the particle density

      allow inactive orbitals, it avoids spurious second-order poles in its
      response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge
      invariant. The OMP2 has these same advantages over canonical MP2, making
      it promising for excited state properties via linear response theory.
      The quadratically convergent orbital-optimization procedure converges
      quickly for OMP2, and provides molecular properties that are somewhat
      different than those of MP2 for most of the test cases considered
      (although they are similar for H$_2$O). Bond lengths are somewhat
      longer, and vibrational frequencies somewhat smaller, for OMP2 compared

      examine the clues available from isotopic ratios (C-12/C-13 and D/H) in
      Titan's methane as to the past atmosphere history of this species. We
      first analyze recent infrared spectra of CH4 collected by the Cassini
      Composite Infrared Spectrometer, measuring simultaneously for the first
      time the abundances of all three detected minor isotopologues:
      (CH4)-C-13, (CH3D)-C-12, and (CH3D)-C-13. From these we compute
      estimates of C-12/C-13 = 86.5 +/- 8.2 and D/H = (1.59 +/- 0.33) x
      10(-4), in agreement with recent results from the Huygens GCMS and
      Cassini INMS instruments. We also use the transition state theory to
      estimate the fractionation that occurs in carbon and hydrogen during a
      critical reaction that plays a key role in the chemical depletion of
      Titan's methane: CH4 + C2H -> CH3 + C2H2. Using these new measurements
      and predictions we proceed to model the time evolution of C-12/C-13 and
      D/H in Titan's methane under several prototypical replenishment
      scenarios. In our Model 1 (no resupply of CH4), we find that the
      present-day C-12/C-13 implies that the CH4 entered the atmosphere
      60-1600 Myr ago if methane is depleted by chemistry and photolysis
      alone, but much more recently-most likely less than 10 Myr ago-if
      hydrodynamic escape is also occurring. On the other hand, if methane has
      been continuously supplied at the replenishment rate then the isotopic
      ratios provide no constraints, and likewise for the case where
      atmospheric methane is increasing. We conclude by discussing how these
      findings may be combined with other evidence to constrain the overall
      history of the atmospheric methane."

      but in sites that differ widely in their allosteric responsiveness. We
      provide novel structural insight into previously uncharacterized
      allosteric forms of these proteins using computational methodologies. We
      find this metal-mediated interaction to be significantly stronger (about
      8 kcal/mol) at functional allosteric metal binding sites compared to a
      nonresponsive site (CadC) and the apo-proteins. Simulations of the
      apo-proteins further reveal that the high interaction energy works to
      overcome the considerable disorder at these hydrogen-bonding sites and
      functions as a switch to lock in a weak DNA-binding conformation once
      metal is bound. These findings suggest a conserved functional role of
      metal-mediated second coordination shell hydrogen bonds at

      interactions, and energy component analysis reveals the contributions
      from the various intermolecular forces: electrostatics, London
      dispersion terms, induction (polarization), and short-range
      exchange-repulsion. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides
      one method for this type of analysis. In this Account, we show several
      examples of how SAPT provides insight into the nature of noncovalent
      $\pi$-interactions. In cation-$\pi$ interactions, the cation strongly
      polarizes electrons in $\pi$-orbitals, leading to substantially
      attractive induction terms. This polarization is so important that a
      cation and a benzene attract each other when placed in the same plane,
      even though a consideration of the electrostatic interactions alone
      would suggest otherwise. SAPT analysis can also support an understanding
      of substituent effects in $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions. Trends in
      face-to-face sandwich benzene dimers cannot be understood solely in
      terms of electrostatic effects, especially for multiply substituted
      dimers, but SAPT analysis demonstrates the importance of London
      dispersion forces. Moreover, detailed SAPT studies also reveal the
      critical importance of charge penetration effects in $\pi$-stacking
      interactions. These effects arise in cases with substantial orbital
      overlap, such as in $\pi$-stacking in DNA or in crystal structures of
      $\pi$-conjugated materials. These charge penetration effects lead to
      attractive electrostatic terms where a simpler analysis based on
      atom-centered charges, electrostatic potential plots, or even
      distributed multipole analysis would incorrectly predict repulsive
      electrostatics. SAPT analysis of sandwich benzene, benzene-pyridine, and
      pyridine dimers indicates that dipole/induced-dipole terms present in
      benzene-pyridine but not in benzene dimer are relatively unimportant. In
      general, a nitrogen heteroatom contracts the electron density, reducing
      the magnitude of both the London dispersion and the exchange-repulsion
      terms, but with an overall net increase in attraction. Finally, using
      recent advances in SAPT algorithms, researchers can now perform SAPT
      computations on systems with 200 atoms or more. We discuss a recent
      study of the intercalation complex of proflavine with a trinucleotide
      duplex of DNA. Here, London dispersion forces are the strongest
      contributors to binding, as is typical for $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions.
      However, the electrostatic terms are larger than usual on a fractional
      basis, which likely results from the positive charge on the intercalator
      and its location between two electron-rich base pairs. These
      cation-$\pi$ interactions also increase the induction term beyond those
      of typical noncovalent $\pi$-interactions."

      hydrogen-bonding changes in the Y122O<95>-diferric cofactor (SIE = 1.4).

      the many-body interaction terms. For electrostatics and induction source
      terms, the relevant quasiparticles are atoms, which are obtained in this

      exchange, induction response, and dispersion terms, the relevant
      quasiparticles are local occupied orbitals, which are obtained in this
      work through the Pipek-Mezey procedure. The local orbital atomic charges
      obtained from ISA additionally allow the terms involving local orbitals
      to be assigned in an atom-pairwise manner. Further summation over the

      localization metric, and induction coupling treatment, and recommend a
      set of practical choices which closes the definition of the A-SAPT0
      partition. We demonstrate the utility and computational tractability of
      the A-SAPT0 partition in the context of side-on cation-{$\pi$}

      expensive as CCSD because there is no need to solve
      $\lambda_2$-amplitude equations for OMP2.5. The performance of the
      OMP2.5 method is compared with that of the standard second-order
      M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), MP2.5, CCSD, and
      coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T))
      methods for equilibrium geometries, hydrogen transfer reactions between
      radicals, and noncovalent interactions. For bond lengths of both closed
      and open-shell molecules, the OMP2.5 method improves upon MP2.5 and CCSD
      by 38\%--43\% and 31\%--28\%, respectively, with Dunning's cc-pCVQZ
      basis set. For complete basis set (CBS) predictions of hydrogen transfer
      reaction energies, the OMP2.5 method exhibits a substantially better
      performance than MP2.5, providing a mean absolute error of 1.1 kcal
      mol$^{-1}$, which is more than 10 times lower than that of MP2.5 (11.8
      kcal mol$^{-1}$), and comparing to MP2 (14.6 kcal mol$^{-1}$) there is a
      more than 12-fold reduction in errors. For noncovalent interaction
      energies (at CBS limits), the OMP2.5 method maintains the very good
      performance of MP2.5 for closed-shell systems, and for open-shell
      systems it significantly outperforms MP2.5 and CCSD, and approaches
      CCSD(T) quality. The MP2.5 errors decrease by a factor of 5 when the
      optimized orbitals are used for open-shell noncovalent interactions, and
      comparing to CCSD there is a more than 3-fold reduction in errors.
      Overall, the present application results indicate that the OMP2.5 method
      is very promising for open-shell noncovalent interactions and other
      chemical systems with difficult electronic structures."

      indicate that the bimetallic mechanism proposed by Jacobsen shows
      nonadditive, cooperative catalysis with a larger reduction in barrier
      height than the sum of the barrier height reductions from the two
      monometallic reaction pathways. We computed barrier heights for the
      reaction using several counterions (chloride, acetate, tosylate, and
      hydroxide). For the three counterions that are experimentally active
      (chloride, acetate, and tosylate) the barrier heights are 35, 38, and 34
      kJ mol(-1), respectively, while for hydroxide it is 48 kJ mol(-1). The
      similarity of the barrier heights for chloride, acetate, and tosylate is
      in agreement with their similar peak reaction rates. The finding that
      Co-salen-X with these counterions leads to rather different overall
      reaction profiles suggests that they have quite different rates of
      reaction with epoxide to form the activated Co-salen-OH required for the
      bimetallic mechanism. Co-salen-OH is inactive as the sole catalyst for
      HKR, and this inactivity is ascribed to its larger barrier height for
      the ring-opening step, rather than to any inability to activate epoxide.
      Barrier heights were also computed using propylene oxide, 1-hexene
      oxide, and epichlorohydrin; propylene oxide and 1-hexene oxide have
      similar barrier heights, 35.5 and 33.2 kJ mol1, respectively, and
      epichlorohydrin has a significantly lower barrier height of 18.8 kJ

    WebMO graphical-user interface and PSI4 suite of quantum chemical 
    programs, which are both available at no cost, can be installed and 
    utilized for educational purposes. More importantly, however, 
    PSI4Education has developed a set of ever-growing, vetted laboratory
    exercises to be employed in the chemistry classroom and laboratory. 
    These are available free of charge for download from our website:
    http://www.psicode.org/labs.php. The labs are created in a flexible 
    manner to be used as-is or tailored for particular use by the educator, 
    and they come with answer keys and various other helpful instructional 
    tools. We welcome further contribution from the community and believe

      trimethylenemethanes (Berson-TMMs) have been investigated by employing
      density functional theory (DFT) and high-level ab initio methods, such
      as the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF),
      multireference second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MRMP2),
      multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles (MRCISD),
      and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples
      [CCSD(T)]. In all computations Pople's polarized triple-zeta split
      valence basis set, 6-311G(d,p), is utilized. The relevant portions of
      the lowest-energy, singlet-spin potential energy surface of the C4H6
      (parent TMM), C6H8 (Berson-TMMa), and C8H12 (Berson-TMMc) chemical
      systems have been explored in order to determine the reaction energies
      and activation parameters accurately, with the ultimate objective of
      providing a theoretical account of experiments by Berson on TMMc. The
      nature of the orthogonal and the planar structures of the parent TMM
      have been clarified in this study. We have concluded that the orthogonal
      TMM B-1(1) minimum has a C-2v symmetry structure, and there is no
      pyramidalization in the unique methylene group. It lies at 13.9 kcal
      mol(-1) above the triplet minimum B-3(2) at MRCISD level. The
      closed-shell (1)A(1), state of the planar TMM is not a true minimum but
      a transition structure (TS) for 180 degrees rotation of the unique
      methylene group in the orthogonal TMM minimum. It lies at 3.0 kcal
      mol(-1) above B-1(1). The planar structures are also involved in the
      interchange of equivalent orthogonal TMMs (o(1), o(2), o(3)). Many
      features of the parent TMM are retained in TMMa and TMMc, despite the
      constraints imposed by the five-membered ring in the latter species.
      Thus, ring closure to the bicyclic molecules 3a (3c) and 5a (5c) takes
      place similarly to that in the parent TMM. Likewise, planar TMMa (TMMc)
      structures are TSs, while orthogonal ones are true minima. The adiabatic
      singlet-triplet gaps are also similar, being 14.7 (13.0) and 16.5 (16.2)
      kcal mol(-1) in the orthogonal (o(1)) and planar TMMa (TMMc),
      respectively. It has been shown here that the substantial reductions in
      the ring-opening barriers of MCP derivatives 3a (3c) and 5a (5c) can be
      largely attributed to ring strain in the former and pi-bond strain in
      the latter species."

      exocyclic groups (such as NH2-NH2) in the major and minor grooves, while

      the twist angles of the ten common Watson-Crick dimer steps both in the

      here still holds when extended to modified bases. In addition to
      Calladine's purine-purine clashes, we add other close contacts between
      bases in the grooves, and consider the conformational restrictions on
      the geometry of the sugar-phosphate backbone (namely, we emphasize the
      tendency of DNA to conserve virtual backbone length). The significance
      of this finding is threefold: (1) sequence-dependent DNA twisting is
      directly involved in protein-DNA interactions; (2) strong correlation

      in the database, involving only unmodified Watson-Crick base pairs (A-T

      the kinematic classification of dinucleotide steps into two main
      classes: rigid and loose (or flexible or bistable). 'Continuously
      flexible' steps are shown to exercise their flexibility along a
      well-defined single-degree-of-freedom pattern, with roll, slide and
      twist all correlated linearly. The rigid steps are AA/TT, AT and GA/TC,
      and the loose (bistable) steps are GG/CC, GC, CG while the loose
      (continuously flexible) steps are CA/TG and TA. AC/GT is the least clear
      of all steps and it is perhaps best described as neither a rigid nor a
      loose step but rather an 'intermediate' step. The base-pair parameters
      are also carefully examined and the resulting pivotal correlation
      between the average propeller and the flexibility of the step (equals
      the standard deviation of slide), that we have recently described

      phosphate backbones in all entries of our database into A-backbone and
      B-backbone conformations. The role of the backbone in determining the
      conformational preferences of the dinucleotide steps is examined by
      demonstrating that whereas the B-backbone conformation permits a fairly
      narrow channel in the roll/slide/twist conformational space, with all
      three parameters linearly correlated, the A-backbone allows only a small
      'box' region near the high-roll, low-twist, low-slide end of the space.

      minimum at the linear Ne-HCN geometry and a narrow and relatively flat
      valley surrounding HCN. Rovibrational calculations on the surfaces
      yielded rotational spectra and a rotational constant whose relative
      differences from their experimental counterparts range from 2\% to 12\%
      depending on the method used to obtain the surface. This large
      sensitivity of spectral quantities to relatively modest differences
      between the potentials is related to the unusual shape of the potential
      well."

      measured the pK(a) values of both nucleoside 3',5'-bis-ethyl phosphates
      [Etp(d/rN)pEt] and nucleoside 3'-ethyl phosphates [(d/rN)pEt] (N = A, G,
      C, or T/U), modeling as donors and acceptors of base pairs in duplexes.
      While the 3',5'-bis-phosphates, Etp(d/rN)pEt, mimic the internucleotidic
      monomeric units of DNA and RNA, in which the stacking contribution is
      completely absent, the 3'-ethyl phosphates, (d/rN)pEt, mimic the
      nucleotide at the 5'-end. The pK(a) values of the nucleobase in each of
      these model nucleoside phosphates have been determined with low pK(a)
      error (sigma = +/-0.01 to 0.02) by H-1 NMR (at 500 MHz) with 20-33
      different pH measurements for each compound. This study has led us to
      show the following: (1) All monomeric DNA nucleobases are more basic
      than the corresponding RNA nucleobases in their respective Etp(d/rN)pEt
      and (d/rN)pEt. (2) The pKa values of the monomeric nucleotide blocks as
      well as DeltapK(a) values between the donor and acceptor can be used to
      understand the relative base-pairing strength in the oligomeric duplexes
      in the RNA and DNA series. (3) The DeltaGdegrees(pKa) of the donor and
      acceptor of the base pair in duplexes enables a qualitative dissection
      of the relative strength of the base-pairing and stacking in the RNA-RNA
      over the DNA-DNA duplexes. (4) It is also found that the relative
      contribution of base-pairing strength and nucleobase stacking in RNA-RNA
      over DNA-DNA is mutually compensating as the percent A-T/U content
      increases or decreases. This interdependency of stacking and hydrogen
      bonding can be potentially important in the molecular design of the
      base-pair mimicks to expand the alphabet of the genetic code."

      conformational structures and we recorded their IR spectra in the
      spectral region of 3000--4000 cm$^{-1}$. Computationally, we
      investigated the PES by a combination of molecular dynamics/quenching
      procedures with high-level correlated ab initio calculations. We found
      that neither empirical potentials nor various DFT functionals provide
      satisfactory results. On the other hand, the approximative DFT method
      covering the dispersion energy yields a reliable set of the most stable
      structures, which we subsequently investigated with an accurate,
      correlated ab initio treatment. The global minimum contains three
      moderately strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds and is mainly stabilized
      by London dispersion forces between the phenyl ring, the carboxylic acid
      group, and various peptide bonds. A proper description of the last type
      of interaction requires accurate correlated ab initio calculations,
      including the complete basis set limit of the MP2 method and CCSD(T)
      correction terms. Since in our beam experiments the conformations are
      frozen by cooling from a higher temperature, it is necessary to localize
      the most stable structures on the free-energy surface rather than on the
      PES. We used two different procedures (rigid rotor/harmonic
      oscillator/ideal gas approximation based on ab initio characteristics
      and evaluation of relative populations from the molecular dynamic
      simulations using the AMBER potential) and both yield four structures,
      the global minimum and three local minima. These four structures were
      among the 15 most energetically stable structures obtained from accurate
      ab initio optimization. The calculated IR spectra for these four
      structures agree well with the experimental frequencies, which validates
      the localization procedure."

      124, 104101 (2006)] that improves the description of the nonbonded

      molecule in s-type Gaussian functions centered at specific sites. In the

      the force field to auxiliary basis sets of arbitrary angular momentum.
      Since the basis functions with higher angular momentum have

      The first is a fully self-consistent treatment of the energy lowering
      due to polarization, which is evaluated by a self-consistent field
      calculation in which the molecular orbital coefficients are constrained
      to be block-diagonal (absolutely localized) in the interacting molecules
      to prohibit charge transfer. The second new feature is the ability to
      separate forward and back-donation in the charge-transfer energy term
      using a perturbative approximation starting from the optimized
      block-diagonal reference. The newly proposed EDA method is used to
      understand the fundamental aspects of intermolecular interactions such
      as the degree of covalency in the hydrogen bonding in water and the
      contributions of forward and back-donation in synergic bonding in metal

      evaluated at the complete basis set (CBS) limit of coupled cluster
      theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples excitations
      [CCSD(T)] using a least biased scheme for the given data set. The
      results for the benzene dimer indicate that the floppy T-shaped
      structure (center-to-center distance: 4.96 Angstrom, with an axial
      benzene off-centered above the facial benzene) is isoenergetic in
      zero-point-energy (ZPE) corrected binding energy (D0) to the
      displaced-stacked structure (vertical interplanar distance: 3.54
      Angstrom). However, the T-shaped structure is likely to be slightly more
      stable (D0 2.4-2.5 kcal/mol) if quadruple excitations are included in
      the coupled cluster calculations. The presence of substituents on the
      aromatic ring, irrespective of their electron withdrawing or donating
      nature, leads to an increase in the binding energy, and the
      displaced-stacked conformations are more stabilized than the T-shaped
      conformers. This explains the wide prevalence of displaced stacked
      structures in organic crystals. Despite that the dispersion energy is
      dominating, the substituent as well as the conformational effects are
      correlated to the electrostatic interaction. This electrostatic origin
      implies that the substituent effect would be reduced in polar solution,
      but important in apolar media, in particular, for assembling
      processes."

      of chemically significant complementary occupied-virtual orbital pairs

      of total binding energy, the $\pi$ cation-$\pi$ interaction is weaker
      than the cation-$\pi$ interaction, but much stronger than the
      $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction. When the hydrophilic (N-H)+ or (C-H)+ group in
      a singly charged $\pi$+ system (as in protonated histidine, arginine,
      pyridine, or dimethyl imidazolium) interacts with a $\pi$-system, the
      complex favors a T-shaped form [$\pi^+$-$\pi$(T) complex]. However, in
      the presence of polar solvating molecules or counteranions, these
      species interact with the (N-H)+/(C-H)+ group, while the $\pi^+$ system
      interacts with the neutral aromatic ring. Then, the displaced-stacked
      form [$\pi^+$-$\pi$(D) complex] is favored or otherwise nearly
      isoenergetic to the $\pi^+$-$\pi(T) form. The $\pi^+$-$\pi$ systems are
      stabilized mainly by both dispersion and electrostatic energies. Ternary
      diagrams using either attractive energy components or both attractive
      and repulsive energy components show that the $\pi^+$-$\pi$(D) complexes
      have more contribution from dispersion energy but less contribution from
      induction energy than the $\pi^+$-$\pi$(T) complexes, while both
      complexes have similar percentage contributions from electrostatic and
      exchange energy components. In particular, the $\pi^+$-$\pi$(D)
      complexes are found to be distinctly different from the $\pi$-$\pi$
      complexes and the non-$\pi$ organic or metallic cation-$\pi$

      and B2K-PLYP, especially with a small Grimme-type empirical dispersion

      quality. These were used as a secondary standard for a larger sample of
      alkanes, including isopentane and the branched hexanes as well as key
      isomers of heptane and octane. Popular DFT functionals like B3LYP,
      B3PW91, BLYP, PBE, and PBE0 tend to overestimate conformer energies
      without dispersion correction, while the M06 family severely
      underestimates GG interaction energies. Grimme-type dispersion
      corrections for these overcorrect and lead to qualitatively wrong
      conformer orderings. All of these functionals also exhibit deficiencies
      in the conformer geometries, particularly the backbone torsion angles.
      The PW6B95 and, to a lesser extent, BMK functionals are relatively free

      Here, based on recent studies about the non-planarity of amino groups on

      groups are non-planar and participate in forming regular inter-base-pair

      the dominant force stabilizing base-pair stacking and play a crucial

      sequence-dependent twisted stacking between adjacent base pairs. The
      model presents a new insight into the link, through regular IBP H-bonds,
      between base-sequence, fine structure and physical properties at
      dinucleotide step level, and provides an attractively concise, uniform
      and quantitative interpretation for various experimentally observed DNA
      sequence-dependent properties in terms of regular IBP H-bonds. It would

      These substituent constants primarily provide a measure of the inductive
      electron-donating and -withdrawing character of the substituents, not
      donation into or out of the benzene pi-system. The present experimental
      results are most readily explained using a recently proposed model of
      substituent effects in the benzene sandwich dimer in which the pi-system
      of the substituted benzene is relatively unimportant and substituent
      effects arise from direct through-space interactions. Specifically,
      these results are the first experiments to clearly show that OMe
      enhances these pi-stacking interactions, despite being a pi-electron

      cancel out in a systematic manner at equilibrium distances. Thus, the
      overall performance of the force fields displays errors an order of
      magnitude smaller than those of the individual interaction energy
      components. The repulsive $1/r^{12}$ component of the van der Waals

      investigate the distance dependence of several types of intermolecular

      dispersion interactions, and X-H center dot center dot center dot pi
      interactions. There are several methods that have traditionally been
      used to treat noncovalent interactions as well as many new methods that
      have emerged within the past three or four years. Here we obtain
      reference data using estimated CCSD(T) values at the complete basis set
      limit (using the CBS(T) method); potential energy curves are also
      produced using several other methods thought to be accurate for

      penetration effects in electrostatic modeling, and we parametrize it and
      illustrate it by employing the electronically embedded combined quantum
      mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method. It can also be
      extended to other molecular modeling approximations that include
      electrostatic effects. The method, which is based on introduction of a
      single parameter for each element, is simple in concept and
      implementation, modest in cost, and easily incorporated into existing
      codes. In the new scheme, the MM atomic charge density of an atom in a
      molecule is represented by a screened charge rather than by a point
      charge. The screened charge includes a point charge for the nucleus,
      core electrons, and inner valence electrons, and a smeared charge for
      the outer valence electron density, which is distributed in a
      Slater-type orbital representing the outer part of the atomic charge
      distribution such that the resulting pairwise interactions are still
      analytic central potentials. We optimize the exponential parameters of
      the Slater-type orbitals for 10 elements, in particular H, C, N, O, F,
      Si, P, S, Cl, and Br, to minimize the mean unsigned error (MUE) of the

      induction-exchange energies calculated by symmetry-adapted perturbation
      theory (SAPT). The resulting optimized exponential parameters are very

      (except rare gases) with atomic number less than or equal to 35. For a
      test set of complexes, the improved description of MM charge densities
      reduces the error of electrostatic interactions between QM and MM

      (difference between the most and least stable geometry) due to the

      mol$^{-1}$, which is almost 50\% of the actual sequence dependence of
      base stacking energies (the energy difference between the most and least

      phase stacking energy using a single geometry for each sequence is
      insufficient to obtain an unambiguous order of gas phase stacking
      energies in canonical double helices. Though the ordering of ten unique

      marginally (on average by 1.14 kcal center dot mol(-1) per base pair
      step) over A-RNA stacking, and this difference vanishes after
      subtracting the stabilizing van der Waals effect of the thymine 5-methyl

      However, for a broad range of stacked dimers, it is shown that
      substituent effects are better described as arising from local, direct
      interactions of the substituent with the proximal vertex of the other
      ring. Consequently, substituent effects in stacking interactions are
      additive, regardless of whether the substituents are on the same or
      opposite rings. Substituent effects are also insensitive to the
      introduction of heteroatoms on distant parts of either stacked ring.
      This local, direct interaction viewpoint provides clear, unambiguous
      explanations of substituent effects for myriad stacking interactions
      that are in accord with robust computational data, including DFT-D and

      recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in
      the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate,
      well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular
      properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these
      methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many
      areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of
      noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly
      influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use
      computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe
      them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction
      energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are
      presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium
      geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation
      curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium
      geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to
      cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules,
      while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic
      contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and
      development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to
      the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the
      interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was
      used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized
      specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD
      method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square

      dispersion) interactions between molecules is a considerable challenge.
      In this work we studied the binding energies for ten small
      non-covalently bonded dimers with several combinations of correlation
      methods (MP2, coupled-cluster single double, coupled-cluster single
      double (triple) (CCSD(T))), correlation-consistent basis sets
      (aug-cc-pVXZ, X = D, T, Q), two-point complete basis set energy
      extrapolations, and counterpoise corrections. For this work, complete
      basis set results were estimated from averaged counterpoise and
      non-counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) binding energies obtained from
      extrapolations with aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. It is
      demonstrated that, in almost all cases, binding energies converge more
      rapidly to the basis set limit by averaging the counterpoise and
      non-counterpoise corrected values than by using either counterpoise or
      non-counterpoise methods alone. Examination of the effect of basis set
      size and electron correlation shows that the triples contribution to the
      CCSD(T) binding energies is fairly constant with the basis set size,
      with a slight underestimation with CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ compared to the
      value at the (estimated) complete basis set limit, and that
      contributions to the binding energies obtained by MP2 generally
      overestimate the analogous CCSD(T) contributions. Taking these factors
      together, we conclude that the binding energies for non-covalently
      bonded systems can be accurately determined using a composite method
      that combines CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ with energy corrections obtained using
      basis set extrapolated MP2 (utilizing aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis
      sets), if all of the components are obtained by averaging the
      counterpoise and non-counterpoise energies. With such an approach,
      binding energies for the set of ten dimers are predicted with a mean
      absolute deviation of 0.02 kcal/mol, a maximum absolute deviation of
      0.05 kcal/mol, and a mean percent absolute deviation of only 1.7\%,
      relative to the (estimated) complete basis set CCSD(T) results. Use of
      this composite approach to an additional set of eight dimers gave
      binding energies to within 1\% of previously published high-level data.
      It is also shown that binding within parallel and parallel-crossed
      conformations of naphthalene dimer is predicted by the composite
      approach to be 9\% greater than that previously reported in the
      literature. The ability of some recently developed dispersion-corrected
      density-functional theory methods to predict the binding energies of the
      set of ten small dimers was also examined."

      dispersion-correcting potentials (DCPs). DCPs are utilized by simple
      modifications to input files and can be used in any computational
      package that can read effective core potentials. Therefore, the
      technique requires no programming. DCPs (developed for H, C, N, and O)
      produce the best results when used in conjunction with 6-31+G(2d,2p)
      basis sets. The B3LYP-DCP approach was tested on the S66, S22, and HSG-A
      benchmark sets of noncovalently interacting dimers and trimers and was
      found to, on average, significantly outperform almost all other
      DFT-based methods that were designed to treat van der Waals
      interactions. Users of B3LYP who wish to model systems in which
      noncovalent interactions (viz., steric repulsion, hydrogen bonding,
      pi-stacking) are present, should consider B3LYP-DCP."

      compared to the more heuristic derivation that was presented previously.
      Applications to various non-covalent complexes and clusters are
      presented, including geometry optimizations and one-dimensional
      potential energy scans. The performance of the XPol+SAPT methodology in
      its present form (based on second-order intermolecular perturbation

      qualitatively acceptable across a wide variety of systems-and
      quantitatively quite good in certain cases-but the quality of the
      results is rather sensitive to the choice of one-particle basis set.
      Basis sets that work well for dispersion-bound systems offer
      less-than-optimal performance for clusters dominated by induction and
      electrostatic interactions, and vice versa. A compromise basis set is
      identified that affords good results for both induction and dispersion

      the stability of host–guest complexes represents a great challenge to
      first-principles calculations due to an interplay of a wide variety of
      covalent and noncovalent interactions in these systems. In particular,
      van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions frequently play a prominent
      role in determining the structure, stability, and function of
      supramolecular systems. On the basis of the widely used benchmark case
      of the buckyball catcher complex (C60@C60H28), we assess the feasibility
      of computing the binding energy of supramolecular host–guest complexes
      from first principles. Large-scale diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
      calculations are carried out to accurately determine the binding energy
      for the C60@C60H28 complex (26 $\pm$ 2 kcal/mol). On the basis of the
      DMC reference, we assess the accuracy of widely used and efficient
      density-functional theory (DFT) methods with dispersion interactions.
      The inclusion of vdW dispersion interactions in DFT leads to a large
      stabilization of the C60@C60H28 complex. However, DFT methods including
      pairwise vdW interactions overestimate the stability of this complex by
      9-17 kcal/mol compared to the DMC reference and the extrapolated
      experimental data. A significant part of this overestimation (9
      kcal/mol) stems from the lack of dynamical dielectric screening effects
      in the description of the molecular polarizability in pairwise
      dispersion energy approaches. The remaining overstabilization arises
      from the isotropic treatment of atomic polarizability tensors and the
      lack of many-body dispersion interactions. A further assessment of a
      different supramolecular system --- glycine anhydride interacting with
      an amide macrocycle --- demonstrates that both the dynamical screening
      and the many-body dispersion energy are complex contributions that are
      very sensitive to the underlying molecular geometry and type of bonding.
      We discuss the required improvements in theoretical methods for
      achieving chemical accuracy in the first-principles modeling of
      supramolecular systems."

   annote = "Noncovalent interactions involving aromatic rings such as
      pi-stacking, cation/pi, and anion/pi interactions are central to many
      areas of modem chemistry. Decades of experimental studies have provided
      key insights into the impact of substituents on these interactions,
      leading to the development of simple intuitive models. However,
      gas-phase computational studies have raised some doubts about the
      physical underpinnings of these widespread models. In this Account we
      review our recent efforts to unravel the origin of substituent effects
      in pi-stacking and ion/pi interactions through computational studies of
      model noncovalent dimers. First, however, we dispel the notion that
      so-called aromatic interactions depend on the aromaticity of the
      interacting rings by studying model pi-stacked dimers in which the
      aromaticity of one of the monomers can be switched off. Somewhat
      surprisingly, the results show that not only is aromaticity unnecessary
      for pi-stacking interactions, but it actually hinders these interactions
      to some extent. Consequently, when thinking about pi-stacking
      interactions, researchers should consider broader classes of planar
      molecules, not just aromatic systems. Conventional models maintain that
      substituent effects in pi-stacking interactions result from changes in
      the aryl pi-system. This view suggests that pi-stacking interactions are
      maximized when one ring is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups
      and the other with electron donors. In contrast to these prevailing
      models, we have shown that substituent effects in pi-stacking
      interactions can be described in terms of direct, local interactions
      between the substituents and the nearby vertex of the other arene. As a
      result, in polysubstituted pi-stacked dimers the substituents operate
      independently unless they are in each other's local environment. This
      means that in pi-stacked dimers in which one arene is substituted with
      electron donors and the other with electron acceptors the interactions
      will be enhanced only to the extent provided by each substituent on its
      own, unless the substituents on opposing rings are in dose proximity.
      Overall, this local, direct interaction model predicts that substituent
      effects in pi-stacking interactions will be additive and transferable
      and will also depend on the relative position of substituents on
      opposing rings. For cation/pi and anion/pi interactions, similar
      pi-resonance-based models pervade the literature. Again, computational
      results indicate that substituent effects in model ion/pi complexes can
      be described primarily in terms of direct interactions between the ion
      and the substituent. Changes in the aryl pi-system do not significantly
      affect these interactions. We also present a simple electrostatic model
      that further demonstrates this effect and suggests that the dominant
      interaction for simple substituents is the interaction of the charged
      ion with the local dipole associated with the substituents. Finally, we
      discuss substituent effec"

      interactions, but the preference for parallel-displaced (PD) and/or
      twisted (TW) over sandwiched (S) conformations is not well understood.
      Orbital interactions are generally believed to play little to no role in
      pi-stacking. However, orbital analysis of the dimers of benzene,
      pyridine, cytosine and several polyaromatic hydrocarbons demonstrates
      that PD and/or TW structures convert one or more pi-type dimer MOs with
      out-of-phase or antibonding inter-ring character at the S stack to
      in-phase or bonding in the PD/TW stack. This change in dimer MO
      character can be described in terms of a qualitative stack bond order
      (SBO) defined as the difference between the number of occupied
      in-phase/bonding and out-of-phase/antibonding inter-ring pi-type MOs.
      The concept of an SBO is introduced here in analogy to the bond order in
      molecular orbital theory. Thus, whereas the SBO of the S structure is
      zero, parallel displacement or twisting the stack results in a non-zero
      SBO and overall bonding character. The shift in bonding/antibonding
      character found at optimal PD/TW structures maximizes the inter-ring
      density, as measured by intermolecular Wiberg bond indices (WBIs).
      Values of WBIs calculated as a function of the parallel-displacement are
      found to correlate with the dispersion and other contributions to the
      pi-pi interaction energy determined by the highly accurate
      density-fitting DFT symmetry adapted perturbation theory (DF-DFT-SAPT)
      method. These DF-DFT-SAPT calculations also suggest that the dispersion
      and other contributions are maximized at the PD conformation rather than
      the S when conducted on a potential energy curve where the inter-ring
      distance is optimized at fixed slip distances. From these results of
      this study, we conclude that descriptions of the qualitative manner in
      which orbitals interact within pi-stacking interactions can supplement
      high-level calculations of the interaction energy and provide an
      intuitive tool for applications to crystal design, molecular recognition
      and other fields where non-covalent interactions are important."

      triple excitations is necessary for achieving a satisfactory accuracy.
      While it is widely used as a benchmark, the accuracy of CCSD(T)
      interaction energies has not been reliably quantified yet against more
      accurate calculations. In this work, we compare the CCSD[T], CCSD(T),

      serve as a benchmark in the cases where CCSDTQ calculations are not

      with the benchmark values than the other noniterative analogs, CCSD(T)

      scheme. The CCSD[T] interaction energies differ from the benchmark data
      by less than 5 cal/mol on average (for all complexes and all basis
      sets), whereas the error of CCSD(T) is 9 cal/mol. In larger systems, the
      difference between these two methods can grow by as much as 0.15
      kcal/mol. While this effect can be explained only as an error
      compensation, the CCSD[T] method certainly deserves more attention in

      energy calculated using standard molecular quantum chemistry for

      These benchmarks are then used to evaluate the accuracy of the

      symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), and the accuracy of SAPT
      based on wave function and density-functional descriptions of the

      MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, SAPT2+/aug-cc-pVDZ, and sSAPT0/jun-cc-pVDZ,
      respectively [Parker, T. M., et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 140, 094106].
      Especially poor results are obtained for symmetric shared-proton systems

      SAPT2+3-delta MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ, outperforms the rest of the SAPT methods,
      with a MAE of 0.2 kcal/mol and a maximum error of 0.4 kcal/mol. For the

      MAE of 0.4 kcal/mol. Despite the breakdown of perturbation theory for
      ionic systems at short-range, SAPT can still be saved given two
      corrections: a delta HF correction, which requires a supermolecular
      Hartree-Fock calculation to incorporate polarization effects beyond
      second order, and a delta MP2 correction, which requires a
      supermolecular MP2 calculation to account for higher-order
      induction-dispersion coupling. These corrections serve to remove
      artifacts introduced by the single exchange approximation in the
      exchange induction and exchange dispersion interactions, and obviate the
      need for ad hoc scaling of the first- and second-order exchange
      energies. Finally, some density-functional and MP2-based electronic
      structure methods are assessed as well, and we find that the best
      density-functional method for computing binding energies in these data
      sets is B97M-V/aug-cc-pVTZ, which affords a MAE of 0.4 kcal/mol, whereas
      complete-basis MP2 affords an MAE of 0.3 kcal/mol."

      These short-range penetration effects can be significant and are

      previously reported (Piquemal, J.-P.; J. Phys. Chem. A 2003, 107) 10353)

      intermolecular distances. Electrostatic, induction/polarization,
      repulsion, and dispersion energies, as well as the total interaction
      energy for each complex in the database are calculated using the SAPT2+

      inter-and intramolecular interactions is essential not only for
      establishing the relation between structure and properties, but also for
      facilitating the rational design of molecules with targeted properties.
      These objectives have motivated the development of theoretical schemes
      decomposing intermolecular interactions into physically meaningful
      terms. Among the various existing energy decomposition schemes,
      Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) is one of the most
      successful as it naturally decomposes the interaction energy into
      physical and intuitive terms. Unfortunately, analogous approaches for
      intramolecular energies are theoretically highly challenging and
      virtually nonexistent. Here, we introduce a zeroth-order wavefunction
      and energy, which represent the first step toward the development of an
      intramolecular variant of the SAPT formalism. The proposed energy
      expression is based on the Chemical Hamiltonian Approach (CHA), which
      relies upon an asymmetric interpretation of the electronic integrals.
      The orbitals are optimized with a non-hermitian Fock matrix based on two
      variants: one using orbitals strictly localized on individual fragments
      and the other using canonical (delocalized) orbitals. The zeroth-order
      wavefunction and energy expression are validated on a series of
      prototypical systems. The computed intramolecular interaction energies
      demonstrate that our approach combining the CHA with strictly localized
      orbitals achieves reasonable interaction energies and basis set
      dependence in addition to producing intuitive energy trends. Our
      zeroth-order wavefunction is the primary step fundamental to the
      derivation of any perturbation theory correction, which has the
      potential to truly transform our understanding and quantification of
      non-bonded intramolecular interactions."
